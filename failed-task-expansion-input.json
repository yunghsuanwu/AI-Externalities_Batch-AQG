You can get a maximum annual credit of $2,500 per\neligible student. If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to zero,\nyou can have 40 percent of any remaining amount of the credit (up to\n$1,000) refunded to you.\nThe amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified\neducation expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent\nof the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that\nstudent.\nWho is an eligible student for AOTC?\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see if you’re eligible to claim an\neducation credit.\n\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the student must:\nBe pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential in a\npost-secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a\n\nUS Department of Education student aid program.\nBe enrolled at least half-time for at least 1 academic period*\nbeginning in the tax year\nNot have finished the first 4 years of higher education at the\nbeginning of the tax year\nNot have claimed AOTC or the former Hope Credit for more than 4\ntax years; AOTC years do not have to be consecutive but do include\nyears the Hope credit was claimed for the same student\nNot have a felony drug conviction at the end of the tax year\n*Academic period can be semesters, trimesters, quarters or any other\nperiod of study such as a summer school session. Schools determine\nacademic periods. For schools that use clock or credit hours and don’t\nhave academic terms, the payment period may be treated as an\nacademic period.\nCourses can be online.\nClaiming the credit\nTo claim AOTC, you must complete the Form 8863 and attach the\ncompleted form to your tax return.\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the law requires the student to have received\nForm 1098-T, Tuition Statement, from an eligible educational\ninstitution, domestic or foreign. Generally, students get the form from\ntheir school by Jan. 31.\n\nIf you received a Form 1098-T, this statement will help you figure your\ncredit. The form will have an amount in Box 1 to show the amounts\nreceived during the year. This amount may not be the amount you can\nclaim. For information on what amount to claim, see qualified\neducation expenses in Tax Benefits for Education, Pub. 970. Check the\nform to make sure it’s correct. If it isn’t correct or you don’t receive the\nform but should, contact the institution.\nIf you didn’t receive Form 1098-T, you may still be eligible to claim a\ncredit. The institution isn't required to furnish Form 1098-T if the\nstudent:\nIs a qualified nonresident alien\nHas qualified education expenses paid entirely with scholarships or\nunder a formal billing arrangement\nIs enrolled in courses for which no academic credit is awarded\nTo claim a credit without it if you otherwise qualify, show that the\nstudent was enrolled at an eligible institution and substantiate the\npayment of the qualified tuition and related expenses.\nBe careful claiming AOTC\nMake sure you’re qualified before claiming the credit. Keep copies of all\ndocuments you used to find out if you qualify and determine the credit\namount.\nIf we audit your return and find your claim is incorrect and you don’t\nhave the documents to show you qualified, you:\n\nMust pay back the amount of the AOTC you received in error with\ninterest\nMay also be charged an accuracy or a fraud penalty\nCan be banned from claiming AOTC for 2 to 10 years\nIf your AOTC claim was disallowed in a previous tax year, you may need\nto file Form 8862 PDF before claiming the credit in future tax years.\nSee My credit was disallowed and now I want to claim it.\nGet TIN before return due date\nYou can only claim AOTC if you, your spouse (if filing jointly) and the\nqualifying student have a valid taxpayer identification number\n(TIN) issued or applied for on or before the return’s due date (including\nextensions).\nYou may not claim AOTC on a later original return or amended return if\nthe TIN is issued or applied for after the return’s due date (including\nextensions).\nAOTC income limits\nTo claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income\n(MAGI) must be $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for married filing\njointly).\nYou receive a reduced amount of the credit if your MAGI is over\n$80,000 but less than $90,000 (over $160,000 but less than $180,000\nfor married filing jointly).\nYou can’t claim the credit if your MAGI is over $90,000 ($180,000 for\njoint filers)."

Vertigo is the sudden feeling of spinning or moving.\nBPPV causes brief periods of mild to intense dizziness. Certain changes in the head's position\nmost often set them off. This might happen from tipping the head up or down, lying down, or\nturning over or sitting up in bed.\nAlthough BPPV can be a bother, it's rarely serious. But it can raise the chance of falling. A\nhealthcare professional can treat BPPV during an office visit.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also called BPPV, may include:\nDizziness.\nA sense of spinning or moving or that the area around you is spinning or moving. This is\ncalled vertigo.\nA loss of balance or not being steady.\nStomach upset and vomiting.\nThe symptoms of BPPV can come and go. Symptoms most often last less than a minute. Bouts\nof BPPV can go away for some time and then come back.\nWhat type of head movement brings on BPPV varies from person to person. But a change in\nhead position almost always is what brings on the symptoms. Some people also feel off balance\nwhen standing or walking.\nAtypical rhythmic eye movements, called nystagmus, most often go with the symptoms of\nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have dizziness or vertigo that is sudden, intense, lasts\nlong or keeps coming back.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\nSeek emergency care e\ne\nF\n\nIt's not common for BPPV to signal a serious illness. But see your healthcare professional right\naway if you have dizziness or vertigo with any of the following:\nA new, different or bad headache.\nA fever.\nSeeing double or not being able to see well.\nHearing loss.\nTrouble talking.\nWeakness in the leg or arm.\nPassing out.\nFalling or trouble walking.\nNumbness or tingling.\nCauses\nOften, there's no known cause for BPPV. This is called idiopathic BPPV.\nWhen there is a known cause, BPPV may be linked with a blow to the head. Less common\ncauses of BPPV include conditions that damage the inner ear.\nRarely, the cause can be damage that happens during ear surgery. Or the symptoms can result\nfrom being on your back for a time, such as during surgery or bed rest.\nThe ear's role\nInside the ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth. It includes three loop-shaped\nstructures called semicircular canals. They have fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that detect the\nhead's movement.\nOther structures in the ear, called otolith organs, detect the head's movements up and down,\nright and left, back and forth. The otolith organs hold crystals that respond to gravity.\nFor many reasons, these crystals can move out of place. When the crystals move, they can go\ninto one of the semicircular canals. Certain head movements can cause the crystals to move.\nWhen the crystals move, they cause the semicircular canal to become sensitive to certain head\nposition changes. This is what causes the dizziness.\nRisk factors\nThe risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is higher in people age 50 and older. But it can\nhappen at any age. The condition is more common in people assigned female at birth.\nA head injury or any other condition of the balance organs of the ear may raise the risk of BPPV.\nThe bone-thinning condition osteoporosis also might be a risk factor.\nComplications\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nBPPV rarely causes complications. The dizziness of BPPV can make you unsteady, which may\nraise your risk of falling and injury from falls.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the\nthings they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate\nbetween bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus\ntickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 2.2.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n2.1« How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\nBudget: $10\nBurgers: $2\nBus Tickets: 50 cents\nsregruB\n29\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\nBus Tickets\nFIGURE 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier Each point on the\nbudget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso’s\nbudget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along\nthe budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.\nThe vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If\nAlphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger =5\nburgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure\nshows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus\ntickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then,\nhowever, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero\nburgers).\nIf we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the\ncombination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget\namount.\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers.\nThat is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point\non (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any\npoint outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his\nbudget.\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.\nSuppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost\nAlphonso for one more burger? It woulbde natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think.\nInstead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying\nwithin his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more\nburger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.\nThe Concept of Opportunity Cost\nEconomists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what people must give up to obtain what they desire.\nThe idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume\nsomething else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the\nopportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to\nchoose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone\nalternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they\nhave to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.\n© I\n\n30 2+ Choice ina World of Scarcity\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your\neconomics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your\nincome on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the\nopportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis ofa budget constraint calculation. Read\nthrough it to understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix The Use\nof Mathematics in Principles of Economics.\nWORK IT T\nUnderstanding Budget Constraints\nBudget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in\nPrinciples of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your\nstrength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.\nStep 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:\nBudget =P; X Q; + P, X Q,\nwhere P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and\nBudget is the amount of income one has to spend.\nStep 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:\nBudget=P;x Q,+ P, X Q,\n$10 budget=$2 per burger X quantity of burgers + $0.50 per bus ticket X quantity of bus tickets\n$10=82 X Qpurgers + $0-50 X Qpus tickets\nStep 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:\ny =b+mx\nFor Alphonso, this is:\n$10 = $2 X Qpurgers *+ $0.50 X Qpus tickets\nStep 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n2% 10 =2 X 2 X Qpurgers + 2 X 0.5 X Qbus tickets\n20 = 4 X Qvurgers + 1 X Qbus tickets\nStep 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:\n20 — Qpus tickets =4 X Qburgers\nDivide each side by 4 to yield the answer:\n5 = 0.25 X Qpus tickets = Qburgers\nor\nQburgers =5 = 0.25 X Qpus tickets\nStep 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope\nis —0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug\nother numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 2.1), which are the points on\nAlphonso’s budget constraint.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n2.1« How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 31\nPoint Quantity of Burgers (at $2) Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)\nA 5 0\nB 4 4\nc 3 8\nD 2 12\nE 1 16\nF 0 20\nTABLE 2.1\nStep 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on\nthe horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is —0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up\n1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.\nThere are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that\nthe only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of\nbus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the\nvertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the\ntwo prices.\nIdentifying Opportunity Cost\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for\n$300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has forsaken. For practical purposes,\nthere may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought\nwith that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true\nopportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team\nspirit.” The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the\nretreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the\ntwo days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket\ncosts of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition,\nduring the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus,\ncollege imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety.\nFor example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel inconspicuously with\nthe rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year.\n\n32 2+ Choice ina World of Scarcity\nRetrofittianlgl U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harfor dterreorirsts to take over the plane would\nhavea price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment fora irports, like three-dimensional\nbaggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\nHowever, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity\ncost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),\nthere were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the\n9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than\nin the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists\ncommonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air\ntravelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air\ntravelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports\ncould be as much as 800 million x 0.5 hours x $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of\nwaiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\nIn some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on\nlunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a\nday, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs\nminus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much.\nHowever, if you project what that adds up to in a year—250 days a year x $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,\nperhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,”\nyou might make different choices.\nAccess for free at openstax.org"

Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of FDIC insurance limits and verification, differences between fixed-rate and market-linked CDs, and warning signs of CD scams, so pay attention to these details. |\n| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about certificates of deposit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to verify whether a CD is actually FDIC-insured and what risks exist when purchasing through third-party brokers. 2. How to evaluate whether your total deposits exceed FDIC coverage limits and what steps to take. 3.

Whether you are considering buying a simple,\nfixed-rate CD or one with more complex features, here are tips for\nselecting the right CD for your financial needs and goals.\nMake sure you are purchasing a “deposit” product issued by an FDIC-\ninsured bank\nNot all companies with bank-sounding names are actually banks that\nare insured by the FDIC. To verify that an institution is FDIC-insured,\ngo to BankFind (https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/bankfind)\nor contact the FDIC’s toll-free Call Center at 1-877-ASK-FDIC\n(tel:18772753342). Also, get more information by reading The\nImportance of Deposit Insurance and Understanding Your Coverage\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2022-\n08.html).\nIf you purchase a CD from a third-party broker instead of directly from\nan FDIC-insured bank, you will have to rely on the broker to make your\ndeposit and acquire the CD on your behalf. The FDIC does not license\nor register deposit brokers and an unscrupulous broker could mislead\nor defraud its customers. If the broker fails to place your funds into a\nCD at an FDIC-insured bank; your money will not be insured by the\nFDIC. Also, be sure to review the account agreement and other\nsupporting documentation to confirm you are in fact purchasing a CD\nand not a financial product that is not insured by the FDIC. To learn\nmore, visit: Is my money insured by the FDIC? What to consider about\nusing a nonbank\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2023-\n07.html).\n\nIf you purchase a CD issued by an FDIC-insured bank where you\nalready have deposits, make sure that all of your funds are insured\nIf the new CD combined with your existing deposits at the same FDIC-\ninsured bank would put your total bank deposits above the $250,000\nFDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount, you may need to\ntake steps to make sure all of your deposits are fully protected.\nRemember, the $250,000 insurance limit includes the principal and\naccrued interest. If you have more than $250,000 on deposit at a FDIC-\ninsured bank, you can call the FDIC toll-free at 1-877-275-3342\n(tel:18772753342) and speak to a deposit insurance specialist who will\nhelp to make sure you are fully insured. You can also use the FDIC\nElectronic Deposit Insurance Estimator or “EDIE” (https://edie.fdic.gov/)\nto verify your deposit insurance coverage. Find more information at\nAre My Deposit Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\ninsured/).\nKnow what your deposit agreement says about your interest\npayments\nSome banks are offering CDs with variable interest rates based on a\npre-set schedule or tied to the performance of a basket of market\nindices (such as the S&P 500, bonds or foreign currency). Many\nmarket-linked CDs accrue interest only when the CD matures, not\nevery day or every month. More information on deposit disclosures is\nprovided in the January 2021 FDIC Consumer News Article\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2021-\n01.html).\nBe suspicious if the advertised CD rate is far above the competition\nCDs or other products may be offered by a company that is not\nfederally insured, in which case any money invested could be lost if\nthe company goes bankrupt. There is also a common marketing ploy\nto lure customers with a temporary high CD rate with the goal of\neventually selling them something else. A very high interest rate\n\nadvertised on an FDIC-insured bank CD could be a scheme created\nwhen a finance company or an insurance agent adds a small bonus to\nthe CD to lure people in the door and, eventually, tries to sell the\ncustomers uninsured, long-term investments that may not be in their\nbest interest.\nFind out if the CD would automatically renew at the maturity date if\nyou do not withdraw the money\nIf that is the case, check to see if the automatic renewal will be at the\n“old” interest rate or the current rate at the time of the renewal. If\nmarket rates have risen, it may not be to your benefit to renew at the\nold rate. Determine whether you can terminate the CD early. The\nterms of most fixed-rate CDs will allow the depositor to pay a fee to\nredeem the deposit prior to maturity. However, most market-linked\nCDs do not allow for an early redemption. Also be aware that market-\nlinked and other long-term, high-yield CDs typically have “call” features\nthat give the bank the right to close the account early. A callable, fixed-\nrate CD could undermine your ability to lock in an attractive, long-term\ninterest rate. Why? If interest rates fall, the issuing bank may decide to\ncall the CD and give you back your money (plus accrued interest)\nbecause it can issue new CDs at the lower interest rates.\nBy making sure you read your deposit agreement closely, you will\nbetter understand terms of the CD you are purchasing. These CD\nshopping tips will help you choose wisely and avoid scams too.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News Banking with Apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2020-\n11.html)\nFact Sheet: What the Public Needs to Know About FDIC Deposit\nInsurance and Crypto Companies (PDF)\n(https://www.fdic.gov/news/fact-sheets/crypto-fact-sheet-7-28-22.pdf)"

When someone with\ncoeliac disease eats gluten, it causes the body’s immune system to\nattack and damage its own tissues. The tissues that can be damaged\nin this way include the lining of the intestine, particularly the finger-\nlike villi. This often leads to nutrients from food not being absorbed\nproperly.\nCoeliac disease is different from food allergy or intolerance. The only\ntreatment for coeliac disease is a strict, life-long, gluten-free diet.\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. These cereals are\ncommonly used in breads, pasta, breakfast cereals, cakes, biscuits\nand pastries.\n\nWho does coeliac disease affect?\nCoeliac disease is common and affects around one in 100 people. It\ncan develop at any age from babies having their first foods right up to\nthe elderly who may have eaten gluten with no problems for most of\ntheir life. There is a strong genetic aspect, with a 10 per cent chance\nof a first degree relative also having coeliac disease. However, we\ndon’t yet know why some people develop coeliac disease and others\ndon’t. Nearly half a million people in the UK are living with coeliac\ndisease but are not yet diagnosed, which can be harmful to their\nhealth.\nSymptoms of coeliac disease\nBefore treatment is started, people with coeliac disease may have\none or several symptoms with differing levels of severity. Symptoms\nmay include:\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal bloating\ntooth enamel defects\nweight loss\niron-deficiency anaemia\nmouth ulcers\nheadache\nfatigue\n\nSome people with coeliac disease may also suffer from anxiety,\ndepression, constipation, tingling or numbness in hands, feet or\nlimbs, problems with walking or balance, and infertility.\nSome people with coeliac disease do not experience any symptoms\nwhen they eat gluten, although the damage gluten causes may still be\noccurring.\nIn addition, some people may develop a very sore, itchy, red rash that\noften shows up symmetrically on the limbs, back or scalp. This may\nbe a condition called Dermatitis Herpetiformis and can be confirmed\nby a dermatologist. It is treated in the same way with a strict life-long\ngluten-free diet.\nDiagnosis\nIf you think you may have coeliac disease you should visit your GP to\nhave a blood test. It is important to keep gluten in your diet for at\nleast one meal every day for six weeks before the blood test and until\nall tests are complete to ensure it is accurate. Some patients may\nneed two blood tests and some may be referred to have a camera\ntest, called an endoscopy, to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment: a gluten-free diet\nThe only treatment for coeliac disease is a strict, life-long, gluten-free\ndiet. Even very tiny amounts, less than a crumb of bread, can cause\nan immune response and potential damage to the body.\n\nRemoving all traces of gluten can be a daunting task, especially when\nyou are first diagnosed. You will need to find out what foods contain\ngluten and how to ensure that your food is safe.\nA dietitian can help by suggesting suitable foods, taking into account\nyour food preferences. They can also help with reading food labels,\nprovide ideas for avoiding all gluten at home and when out and\nabout, and helping to ensure there is no cross contamination. A\ndietitian will also help you to include all the necessary nutrients such\nas energy, fibre, vitamins and minerals (such as calcium and iron) in\nyour diet.\nLots of foods are naturally gluten free and can still be enjoyed on a\ngluten-free diet, see below:\n\nFood group Naturally gluten-free,\nsome examples\nFruit and All fresh, frozen and canned\nVegetables fruit and vegetables\nStarchy Potatoes, rice, cassava, corn,\nCarbohydrates millet, buckwheat, quinoa,\nteff, gluten-free oats\nDairy foods Milk, cheese, plain or fruit\nand yoghurt (without toppings),\nalternatives soya milk, rice milk or nut\nmilks\nProtein-rich Unprocessed meat, fish,\nfoods beans, pulses, lentils, nuts,\neggs\nGluten is found in wheat, rye and barley, so avoid foods made with\nthese cereal grains. Breads, pasta, breakfast cereals, cakes, biscuits,\nand pastries are usually made with wheat flour and contain\ngluten. These foods can be substituted with gluten-free products\nfound in the free-from sections of the supermarket, including the\n\nfreezer, chiller and bread shelves. These gluten-free foods often cost\nmore. Some people will be able to get gluten-free food on\nprescription from their GP depending on local availability.\nIn the UK, for a food to be labelled ‘gluten free’ it must contain no\nmore than 20 parts per million of gluten. This is the level of gluten\nwhich has been demonstrated to be safe for people with coeliac\ndisease. Codex wheat starch (sometimes referred to as ‘gluten-free\nwheat starch’) is found in some gluten-free products. The gluten has\nbeen removed from this ingredient, so the product containing it is\nstill safe to eat, if labelled as ‘gluten free’. Similarly, some products\nmay contain barley malt extract - provided the product is labelled\n‘gluten free’, it is also safe to eat.\nThe charity Coeliac UK has many helpful resources and apps to help\nyou identify which foods are suitable to eat in all sections of the\nsupermarket. The picture of Coeliac UK’s Crossed Grain symbol is\nalso useful as a trusted sign that a packaged food is gluten free.\nCrossed Grain certified products have been through extra checks\nincluding gluten analysis certificates and independent audits of how\nthey are manufactured to ensure people with coeliac disease can be\nconfident these products are suitable for a gluten-free diet.\nWhat is cross contamination?\nCross contamination occurs when gluten-free food comes into\ncontact with gluten. For example, when sharing a toaster, crumbs\nfrom gluten-containing bread can touch and contaminate your\ngluten-free toast, making it unsafe to eat.\nOats are often contaminated with wheat, rye and barley during\ngrowing, harvesting and production. If you have coeliac disease it is\nessential you only eat oats that are labelled as gluten-free. A small\n\nproportion of people may be sensitive to oats and have symptoms\nwhen eating gluten-free oats. Discuss this with your dietitian if you\nthink this is the case.\nTop tips\nGluten-free bread sometimes tastes better baked or toasted; try\nseveral products as they do differ. Companies may give a\nsample pack for newly diagnosed patients to try.\nUse a separate margarine, nut butter or jam to reduce risk of\ncross contamination.\nTry using a toaster pocket if you’re using a toaster that is also\nused to toast gluten-containing bread.\nTry to go for naturally gluten-free foods to reduce the impact of\nthe higher cost of gluten-free products.\nTake snacks or a packed lunch if you are not sure if there will be\ngluten-free options when you are away from home.\nLook for gluten-free nights at fish and chip restaurants – this is\noften when they change the cooking oil to prevent cross\ncontamination.\nFor eating out, call ahead and ask questions about how your\nfood will be prepared. This will help you identify if your meal is\ntruly gluten free.\nFor eating out, look out for the Coeliac UK GF accreditation - this\nmeans Coeliac UK have audited the venue's processes to ensure\nthey meet the required standard to offer safe gluten-free food\nand ensures the staff have been trained to understand coeliac\ndisease and the requirements of the gluten-free diet.\nDiscuss your diagnosis with friends and family (or your child’s\nschool if your child is affected) so they can support a gluten-free\n\ndiet.\nJoin supportive groups such as coeliac local support groups in\nyour area, coeliac groups online or via social media to get\nsupport and more information on travelling, or recipe ideas."

It measures how much pressure debt is putting on your budget, which helps you\ndecide if you can handle more debt.\nFor example, if you have a debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent, then 36 cents of every\ndollar earned is going to pay for debt, leaving you 64 cents to pay for everything else.\nA high debt-to-income ratio could affect your ability to get additional credit because\ncreditors may be concerned that you won’t be able to handle their debt on top of what\nyou already owe.\nYou can also use the debt-to-income ratio as a benchmark for reducing your debt—as your\ndebt decreases, so will your debt-to-income ratio.

Revisions included increases to the standard salary level\nand the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism for updating these earnings\nthresholds to reflect current earnings data. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated\nthe Department's 2024 final rule. Consequently, with regard to enforcement, the Department is applying the 2019 rule's minimum\nsalary level of $684 per week and total annual compensation requirement for highly compensated employees of $107,432 per year.\nLawsuits regarding the 2024 final rule are currently pending in two other federal district courts, and the United States has filed a\nnotice of appeal from the November 15 decision. The Department will update this notice with additional information as it becomes\navailable.\nThis fact sheet provides general information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the\nFLSA as defined by Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 541.\nThe FLSA requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime\npay at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\nHowever, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona\nfide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain\ncomputer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a\nsalary basis at not less than $684 per week. Employers may use nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions)\npaid on an annual or more frequent basis, to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level. Job titles do not determine exempt status.\nIn order for an exemption to apply, an employee’s specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the Department’s\nregulations.\nSee other fact sheets in this series for more information on the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside\nsales employees, and for more information on the salary basis requirement.\nExecutive Exemption\nTo qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be managing the enterprise, or managing a customarily recognized department or subdivision of\nthe enterprise;\nThe employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of at least two or more other full-time employees or their equivalent; and\nThe employee must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee’s suggestions and recommendations as to the\nhiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given particular weight.\nAdministrative Exemptions\nTo qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general\nbusiness operations of the employer or the employer’s customers; and\nThe employee’s primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\nProfessional Exemption\nTo qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, defined as work which is\npredominantly intellectual in character and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment;\nThe advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and\nThe advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.\nTo qualify for the creative professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized\nfield of artistic or creative endeavor.\nComputer Employee Exemption\nTo qualify for the computer employee exemption, the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated either on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week\nor, if compensated on an hourly basis, at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour;\nThe employee must be employed as a computer systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer or other similarly skilled\nworker in the computer field performing the duties described below;\nThe employee’s primary duty must consist of:\n1. The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware,\nsoftware or system functional specifications;\n2. The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs,\nincluding prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;\n3. The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or\n4. A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\n\nBlue-Collar Workers\nThe exemptions provided by FLSA Section 13(a)(1) apply only to “white-collar” employees who meet the salary and duties tests set forth in\nthe Part 541 regulations. The exemptions do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue-collar” workers who perform work involving\nrepetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. FLSA-covered, non-management employees in production, maintenance,\nconstruction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers,\nlongshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the FLSA, and are not\nexempt under the Part 541 regulations no matter how highly paid they might be.\nPolice, Fire Fighters, Paramedics & Other First Responders\nThe exemptions also do not apply to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators,\ninspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians,\nambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank or pay level, who perform\nwork such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires of any type; rescuing fire, crime or accident victims; preventing or detecting\ncrimes; conducting investigations or inspections for violations of law; performing surveillance; pursuing, restraining and apprehending\nsuspects; detaining or supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including those on probation or parole; interviewing witnesses;\ninterrogating and fingerprinting suspects; preparing investigative reports; or other similar work."

      "reference_material_content": "The Roman and Han Empires 95\ne\nTHE HAN EMPIRE\nWhile the Pax Romana unified the Mediterranean basin, China’s classical civilization, the Han empire, developed\nalong similar lines. The Han empire (206 sce to 220 ce) would prove the longest and most influential of all\nChinese dynasties, prompting the Chinese of future generations to refer to themselves as “People of Han.”\nThe Han Dynasty was preceded by the Qin Dynasty (whose internal improvements would have a bearing on the\nsuccess of the Han Dynasty). The Qin arose after the collapse of the Zhou Dynasty in the third century sce.\nThe Qin were noted for their extensive use of bronze and iron. Their most lasting achievement, however, was the\nconstruction of public works such as canals and roadways. The Chinese had long possessed a line of walls to\nhold back the advances of invaders. Under the Qin, these walls were connected, resulting in the beginning\nstages of the Great Wall, a 1,400-mile structure that protected the Chinese from potential invaders from the\nwest and north.\nUpon coming to power, Liu Bang, the founding Han ruler, immediately instituted a strong centralized government\nthat ensured peace and stability for the Chinese people. Particularly influential was Empress Lii (195-180 ace),\nwho seized and retained control over the throne by naming her infant sons as emperors. The achievements\nof the Qin were expanded by the longest-ruling of the Han rulers, Han Wudi (141-87 sce), who appointed\nprovincial administrators to promote governmental efficiency.\nDuring the Han Dynasty, Chinese emperors used a complex bureaucracy to aid their rule. To pay for this large\nbureaucracy, as well as for the imperial army, the government levied taxes. Chinese peasants paid their taxes by\ngiving the government part of their yearly crop. Merchants also paid taxes. In addition to taxes, peasants also\nwere required to give the government a month's worth of labor or military service every year. Han emperors\nused this source of labor to build roads, dig canals, and create irrigation systems.\nRoads and canals encouraged trade and communication throughout the Han empire. The Silk Roads linked\nChina to the Mediterranean world. Some of the Han people migrated southward into the present-day areas of\nBurma, Laos, and Thailand. Like Rome, the Han empire expanded its borders, expanding into Korea and Vietnam\nand encouraging the assimilation of those areas into Chinese culture. Most Han Chinese were farmers; however,\nthe rapid growth of the iron industry produced fine manufactured goods for trade along the Silk Roads.\nKnowledge of the production of silk spread to most parts of China; silk was a valued commodity in long-distance\ntrade with the West, especially with the Roman Empire.\nFunded by taxes on trade, agriculture, and the work of artisans, the Han Empire boasted an imperial university.\nThe shi, or scholar class, promoted education, while the first civil service examination was instituted under the Han.\nKAPLAN)\n\nThe prosperity of the Han period produced significant population growth as well as technology more advanced\nthan that of any other classical civilization. Among the inventions and advances attributed to the Han are\npaper, the rudder, the compass, porcelain, the seismograph, acoustical studies, and a calendar of 365 days. It\nis possible that the practice of acupuncture originated with the Han.\nThe Decline of the Han\nIn spite of the achievements of the Han period, the empire also saw inequities which, as in the case of Rome,\nprecipitated its decline and eventual fall. Land was distributed unequally between rich and poor. Women were\nkept in a subordinate position, although upper-class women were often educated in writing and the fine\narts. The Hsiung-nu, peoples along the Han borders whom the Chinese considered barbarians, presented an\never-present threat; the Han Chinese paid them tribute to prevent them from invading Chinese territory. The\neconomic strain of efforts to contain the Hsiung-nu and expand the empire further weakened it. Han Wudi\nconfiscated the property of the upper class, a policy which weakened both trade and manufacturing. Peasants\ncontinued to revolt against their plight. A series of poor harvests prompted many small landowners to sell their\nproperty or even themselves into slavery.\nInept rule by the successors of Han Wudi led to the overthrow of the Han dynasty in 6 ce by Wang Mang. The\nStrict control executed by Wang, however, led to peasant rebellion resulting in the overthrow of Wang in 23 ce\nand the restoration of the Han. Still plagued by poor emperors and internal weakness, the later Han were forced\nto contend with repeated invasions of the Hsiung-nu. Epidemic disease significantly reduced the population of\nthe Han empire as it had in Rome. Han generals increasingly seized power as the empire declined. The collapse\nof the Han empire in 220 ce allowed barbarians into the Chinese borders, producing 400 years of political and\neconomic turmoil and the division of the former empire into numerous regional kingdoms.\nTHE SILK ROADS\nAn intelligence mission undertaken by an envoy of Han Wudi led to the opening of the Silk Roads, which\neventually would link western China to the easternmost reaches of the Roman empire. Embracing both land\nand sea routes, the Silk Roads would play a prominent role in world history during two periods, the first from\n150 sce to 900 ce. During this period, the Silk Roads were used by nearby societies who were attracted to the\nwealth and material goods of the classical empires. Trade routes encompassed by the Silk Roads included the\nregions of central Asia, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian Ocean. In the Indian Ocean, an active\nroute linked Ceylon and India with the societies of Southeast Asia. Pastoral nomads from the Steppes of central\nAsia proved key players in the story of the Silk Roads—sometimes by threatening to interfere with trade and\nsometimes by fostering conditions that led to improved trade connections. Travelers and traders could acquire\npack animals and buy protection through tribute payments to nomadic peoples.\nTrade along the Silk Roads promoted the development of regional resources and manufactures offered as trade\nitems. Among the items traded along the Silk Roads were spices, jewels, cosmetics, grain, wine, olivé oil, and\njewelry. The introduction of the stirrup spread both east and west, contributing to the success of the cavalry in\nChina and the horsemanship of the European medieval knight.\nFew people traveled the entire length of the Silk Roads with their merchandise; instead, they relied on middlemen\nto transport their goods part of the distance. Indians and Parthians (from the present-day Persian: Gulf area)\nKAPLAN)\n\nThe Roman and Han Empires 97\nwere particularly active as middlemen along the Silk Roads, as were the Jews, Greeks, and Armenians in the\nMediterranean basin. Malay merchant mariners were noted for their long-distance voyages from the islands of\nsoutheast Asia to both India and East Africa, capitalizing on the seasonal patterns of monsoon winds to facilitate\ntheir journey.\nReligion Along the Silk Roads\nBy the first century sce, Buddhism had traveled the Silk Roads through the travels of merchants, reaching as far\nas China. Oasis towns along the Silk Roads harbored Buddhist monasteries that served as inns for early traders.\nNomadic peoples along the Silk Roads would trade with oasis cities and, in the process, learn of Buddhism. By\nthe fifth century ce, the Chinese had become sufficiently comfortable with the presence of the Buddhist monks,\nnuns, and traders among them to accept the Buddhist faith in a widespread fashion. Both Buddhism and Hinduism\nspread through Indian Ocean trade to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Malay peninsula, Cambodia, and\nVietnam.\nChristianity diffused across the land routes and sea lanes of the Silk Roads through the activity of missionaries.\nBy the third century ce, Christianity had reached central Anatolia, and Christian communities had emerged\nthroughout the Mediterranean basin as far as Spain and Gaul as well as North Africa. Christianity also spread to\nPersia and India, remaining a prominent faith in those areas even after the arrival of Islam in the 600s. By the\nthird century ce, Christian monasteries began to form in the Roman world.\nAnother religion that traveled the Silk Roads was Manichaeism, named after its founder Mani (216-272 ce).\nAppealing to merchants, Manichaeism was a blend of beliefs of other major religions and considered Zoroaster\n(Zarathustra) as the prophet of Persia, Buddha as the prophet of India, and Jesus as the prophet of the\nMediterranean basin. Manichaeism held that life was a struggle between good and evil and that good could be\nachieved by abandoning worldly pleasure. A life after death awaited those who achieved the good in this life in\nan eternity filled with goodness and light. The subject of persecution by the Sasanids of Persia and the Romans,\nManichaeism was transmitted to central Asia, where it was accepted by some of the Turkish nomads.\nEpidemic Disease Along the Silk Roads\nEpidemic disease transmitted along the Silk Roads accounted for sharp population declines in the final days\nof both the Roman and Han empires, with China affected by epidemic disease slightly later than the Roman\nworld. Persia also appears to have suffered from outbreaks of epidemic disease. India, however, apparently was\nspared a major outbreak of epidemic disease. In both China and Rome, Silk Road trade declined as a result of\nthe reduction in population.\nKAPLAN)"

      "reference_material_content": "I<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 6\nCENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS\nNerve Cells\nGenerally speaking, there are three kinds of nerve cells in the nervous system: sensory\nneurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons (also known as afferent\nneurons) transmit sensory information from receptors to the spinal cord and brain. Motor\nneurons (also known as efferent neurons) transmit motor information from the brain and\nspinal cord to the muscles. Interneurons are found between other neurons and are the most\nnumerous of the three types of neurons. Interneurons are.located predominantly in the brain\n140\n\n| IK\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nPhysiological Psychology\nand spinal cord and are linked to reflexive behavior. This type of behavior is controlled by\nneural circuits called reflex arcs. Behavior that is crucial to survival is controlled by reflexes.\nWhen receptors in the foot detect pain (e.g., when you step on a nail), the pain signal is\ntransmitted by sensory neurons up to the spinal cord. At that point, the sensory neurons\nconnect with interneurons, which then relay pain impulses up to the brain. Because\ninterneurons in the spinal cord are closer to your foot, it would be faster if they could tell\nyour foot to move instead of waiting for the brain to do it. In fact, this is exactly what happens\nin the reflex arc. Sensory neurons first send out impulses signaling the presence of pain. As\nsoon as the impulses arrive at the spinal cord, interneurons immediately transmit that\ninformation to the motor neurons. Without wasting any time, the motor neurons tell your\nfoot to step away from the nail. Bear in mind that the original sensory information still makes\nits way up to the brain. But by the time it arrives there, the muscles have already responded\nto the pain, thanks to the reflex arc.\nAs mentioned earlier, functionalists such as John Dewey criticized the breaking down of\nreflex processes into separate stimuli and responses. Functionalists preferred to study the\nprocess as a whole. To break down the reflex arc into different motor and sensory phases, was,\nfor Dewey, a useless artificial separation.\nHuman Nervous System\nLet’s turn now to the overall structure of the human nervous system, which is diagrammed\nin Figure 1. The nervous system can be broadly divided into two primary components: the\ncentral and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS), is composed of\nthe brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS), in contrast, is made up of\nnerve tissue and fibers outside the brain and spinal cord (i.e., the PNS connects the CNS to\nthe rest of the body). The peripheral nervous system is subdivided into somatic and\nautonomic nervous systems.\nNervous System .\nCentral Nervous System Peripheral Nervous System\nBrain . Spinal. Cord Somatic Autonomic\nP Nervous Nervous\nSystem System\nParasympathetic Sympathetic\nNervous Nervous\nSystem System\nFigure 1. Major Subdivisions of the Nervous System\n141\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 6\nThe somatic nervous system consists of sensory and motor neurons distributed throughout\nthe skin and muscles. Sensory neurons transmit information through afferent fibers. Motor\nimpulses, in contrast, travel along efferent fibers. Since it’s easy to confuse these two, try to\nremember them like this: sensory impulses travel along afferent fibers, which ascend up to\nthe brain; motor impulses travel along efferent fibers, which exit the brain and spinal cord on\ntheir way down to the muscles. The GRE Psychology Test tends not to ask much about the\nsomatic nervous system.\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) appears often on the GRE Psychology Test, so it’s worth\nknowing in some detail. Pioneering work in regard to the ANS was done by Walter Cannon.\nThe ANS generally regulates heartbeat, respiration, digestion, and glandular secretions. In\nother words, the ANS manages the involuntary functions associated with many internal\norgans and glands. The ANS also helps regulate body temperature by activating sweating or\nshivering, depending on whether we are too hot or too cold. The main thing to understand\nabout these functions is that they are automatic, or independent of conscious control. Note\nthe similarity between the words autonomic and automatic. This association makes it easy to\nremember that the autonomic nervous system manages automatic functions such as\nheartbeat, respiration, digestion, and temperature control.\nThe ANS has two subdivisions: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic\nnervous system. These two branches often act in opposition to one another, meaning that\nthey are antagonistic. An illustration of this is that the sympathetic nervous system acts to\naccelerate heartbeat and inhibit digestion. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system,\nin contrast, decelerates heartbeat and increases digestion.\nThe main role of the parasympathetic nervous system is to conserve energy. It is associated\nwith resting and sleeping states, and acts to reduce heart and respiration rates. The\nparasympathetic nervous system is also responsible for managing digestion. The\nparasympathetic nervous system thus promotes “resting and digesting”—a phrase that\ncaptures what you need to know for the test. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter\nresponsible for parasympathetic responses in the body.\nIn contrast, the sympathetic nervous system is activated whenever you face stressful\nsituations. This can include everything from a mild stressor, such as keeping up with your\nschoolwork, to emergencies that mean the difference between life and death. The sympathetic\nnervous system is closely associated with fear and rage reactions, also known as “fight or\nflight” reactions. Because the sympathetic nervous system often appears on the test, it’s a\ngood idea to know some specific physiological responses associated with “fight or flight”\nreactions. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the body mobilizes for fighting\nfor one’s life, or for running for one’s life. Therefore, there are increases in heart rate, blood-\nsugar level, and respiration. In contrast to the parasympathetic activation, “fight or flight”\nreactions act to decrease digestive processes. The sympathetic nervous system also causes\nthe pupils in the eyes to dilate (open wider) in order to increase the amount of visual\ninformation reaching the retina. Also, the neurotransmitter adrenaline is released into the\n142\n\n| IK\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nPhysiological Psychology\nbloodstream during fear and rage reactions. An “adrenaline rush” gives you more energy than\nusual in order to contend with emergencies; it helps you run faster or fight harder at times\nwhen you need everything you've got. Overall, most of the physiological responses associated\nwith the sympathetic nervous system act in ways to maximize energy for quick responses to\nthreatening situations.\nparietal lobe\nfrontal lobe\ncorpus callosum fs) thalamus\noccipital lobe\n=e Ca- ae\nsuperior and\nmidbrain\npituitary gland & £5 BF\nnies fe ;\noy cerebellum\npons varolii\nmedulla\nspinal cord\nFigure 2.

If your kidneys are not working so well, some\nchanges in the diet help you feel better.\nImportance of Good Nutrition for\nPeople with Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nMaking healthy food choices is important to us\nall, and especially if you have chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD). Good nutrition helps:\nSlow down the progression of kidney disease\n\nProvide energy to do your daily tasks\nPrevent infection\nMaintain muscle mass and strength\nMaintain a healthy weight\nThe Basics of Good Nutrition\nA well-balanced diet gives you the right\namounts of protein, calories, vitamins, and\nminerals each day. Eating a healthy diet, staying\nphysically active, and taking all your medicines\nas prescribed are all important parts to keeping\nyou healthy and feeling well.\n\nChanges to My Diet\nYour kidneys help keep the right balance of\nnutrients and minerals in your body. But if you\nhave kidney disease, your kidneys may not do\nthis job very well. You may need to make some\nchanges to your diet.\nThere is not only one correct eating plan for\neveryone with kidney disease. What you can or\ncannot eat may change over time, depending\non your kidney function and other factors. If you\nare following a certain eating plan for diabetes\nor heart disease, you will continue to do so.\nWhat is good for your diabetes and heart is\ngood for your kidney. A kidney dietitian will help\nyou combine these eating plans.\n\nPeople with CKD may need to control the\namount or type of one or more nutrients:\nSodium\nPotassium\nPhosphorus\nCalcium\nProtein\nEating the right amount or type of one or more\nof these nutrients may help control the buildup\nof waste and fluid in your blood. This means\nyour kidneys do not have to work as hard to\nremove the extra waste and fluid. If your kidney\ndisease gets worse, you may need to limit other\nnutrients as well. Your dietitian or healthcare\nprovider will tell you if you need to do this\nbased on your blood test results.\nSodium and your CKD Diet: How to Spice\nUp Your Cooking\nHealthy kidneys control how much sodium is in\nyour body. If your kidneys do not work well, too\nmuch sodium can cause fluid buildup, swelling,\nhigher blood pressure, and strain on your heart.\nYour dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you\n\nthe right amount of sodium you should have\neach day.\nPotassium\nPotassium is important for muscle function,\nincluding the heart muscle. Too much or too\nlittle potassium in the blood can be very\ndangerous. The amount of potassium you need\nis based on how well your kidneys are working\nand your medications. Your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider can tell you about foods\nwith potassium and the right amount for you to\neat each day.\nPotassium from animal foods is absorbed at a\nhigher rate than potassium from plants.\nElevated blood sugars can also increase\npotassium levels. Some high-potassium foods\ninclude milk, meat, bananas, oranges and\norange juice, cantaloupe, dried fruits, winter\nsquash and salt substitutes.\nPhosphorus and Your Diet\nAs kidney function gets lower, extra\nphosphorus can start building up in the blood.\nHigh phosphorus levels can cause bones to get\nweaker. Your dietitian or healthcare provider\n\ncan tell you if you need to limit goods that are\nhigh in phosphorus.\nHigh phosphorus foods include dairy products,\norgan meats, colas, deli meats, and processed\nfoods with phosphate additives.\nAvoid processed foods that have additives with\nPHOS like disodium PHOSphate. You can find\nthese additives in the ingredients list on food\nlabels.\nCalcium\nFoods that are good sources of calcium are\noften high in phosphorus. Your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider will tell you if you need to\nlimit calcium. Before taking any over-the-\ncounter vitamin D or calcium supplements, talk\nto your healthcare provider.\nProtein\n\nYour body needs protein to help build muscle,\nrepair tissue, and fight infection. Plant-based\nprotein like beans and nuts are easier on the\nkidneys than animal proteins like meat and\ndairy products. This is because plant proteins\nproduce less acid in the body than meat\nproteins. More acid in body can damage the\nkidneys.\nHaving very large amounts of protein,\nespecially in the form of unnecessary\nsupplements, can be stressful on the kidneys.\nBut if protein intake is too low, you can lose\nmuscle mass, become weak, and increase the\nbody’s acid load, so it is important to eat the\nright amount each day. The amount of protein\nyou need is based on:\nYour weight\nYour age – growing children and adolescents,\nand older people, need more protein\nThe amount of protein in your urine, and\ndepending on your type of kidney disease\nYour dietitian or healthcare provider can tell\nyou how much protein you should eat.\nFluids\n\nThe Dos and Don'ts of Fluid Management in\nChronic Kidney Disease\nMost people in the early stages of kidney\ndisease do not need to limit how much fluid\nthey drink. If you do not know your stage of\nkidney disease, ask your healthcare provider. If\nyour kidney disease worsens, your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider can let you know if you\nneed to limit fluids and how much to drink each\nday. Fluids may need to be limited based on\nhow much urine you make each day, and if fluid\nbuild-up in your body is causing swelling or\nstress on your heart or lungs.\nFluids include any food that is liquid at room\ntemperature such as beverages, soups, gelatin,\nfrozen desserts, and ice.\nCalories\nEvery person is different in terms of the calories\nthey need each day. Calories are like fuel. If you\ndon’t eat enough, your body will take protein\nfrom the muscles for energy. It’s important to\nmake sure you get the right number of calories.\nIf you don’t, you may get weak and damage\nyour kidneys. Eating the right number of\ncalories will:\n\nHelp you stay at a healthy weight\nGive you the energy to do your daily tasks\nHelp your body use the protein in food to\nbuild muscle and tissues\nToo many calories can cause extra weight gain,\nwhich can burden the kidneys. If you are\noverweight, some weight loss may be helpful. If\nweight loss is desired or you have diabetes, you\nshould meet with a dietitian to set up a plan\nbased on your kidney blood tests, current food\nchoices, and daily activities.\nVitamins and Minerals\nVitamins and Minerals in Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nMost people get enough vitamins and minerals\nto stay healthy by eating a variety of foods each\nday. But kidney patients may need to limit some\nof these foods. If so, you may need to take\nspecial vitamin or mineral supplements, but\nonly if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells\nyou to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements\nmay be harmful to people with kidney disease.\nYou should check with your healthcare provider\n\nbefore taking any medications you can buy\nwithout a prescription. Some supplements may\nbe harmful to people with kidney disease. Over\nthe counter vitamin and mineral supplements\nmay contain too much phosphorous and\npotassium. You should also avoid taking herbal\nsupplements."

      "reference_material_content": "SAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nBIOLOGY OF INHERITANCE\n‘\nAn organism’s genes determine its features, its characteristics, its appearance—in other words,\nits traits.\nWhen talking about an organism’s traits, we say phenotype. If you're a cat and your fur is gray,\nthen we say that, in terms of fur color, your phenotype is gray. If your fur is white, then we\nsay, in terms of fur color, your phenotype is white. If we meet a person who has diabetes, we\nsay that, in terms of diabetes, his phenotype is diabetic. If we meet another person who does\nnot have diabetes, we say that in terms of diabetes, her phenotype is nondiabetic, or we might\nsay that her phenotype is normal. So phenotype just refers to the actual traits that an organism\ndoes and does not possess.\nPHENOTYPE AND GENES\nAs you'll remember, we said that, generally speaking, chromosomes are arranged in homolo-\ngous pairs. Each member of the pair is similar to, but also different from, the other member.\nLet’s look at one pair of chromosomes, and, in particular, let’s focus on one part of each chro-\nmosome. We want to make the picture easy to look at, so we won't bother with actually shaping\nthe chromosomes like a double helix/twisted ladder.\nBlack fur Black fur\nNotice that each of these shaded portions is labeled “black fur.” This means that the particular\npart of the chromosome that we've decided to look at codes for fur color.\nNow, this particular pair of chromosomes codes for enzymes that give\nWhen we say phenotype, we're\nrise to black fur. So, when it comes to fur color, what is this organism’s\ntalking about the organism and\nphenotype? Simple—it’s black.\nits traits. But when we say geno-\ntype, were talking about the\nGo fibs tego nile for those tials Now, while we're looking at these two chromosomes, let’s introduce\nanother word: genotype. The genotype is the description of which versions\n160 | For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nof a gene an organism has on its chromosomes. For the organism that we're now talking about—\nthe one with the black fur—we'd (1) look at the homologous chromosome pair pictured above,\n(2) see that both homologous chromosomes show a gene for black fur, and (3) say\nFur Color Genotype: black/black (or BB)\nFur Color Phenotype: black\nMore About Genotype and Phenotype: Features That Are\nDominant and Recessive\nLet’s consider another organism with black fur. When it comes to fur, what’s the organ-\nism’s phenotype? It’s black.\nNow let’s look at its genotype. Here are the chromosomes that contain the genes responsible for\nfur color.\nBlack fur White fur\nNotice, then, that in this example there are two “versions” of the gene for fur color—a black fur\nversion and a white fur version. When the two copies of a gene are different versions, it is called\nheterozygous. If the versions are the same it is called homozygous. Versions of a gene are called\nalleles, and we can refer to the black fur allele or the white fur allele.\nThe two homologous chromosomes don’t agree on what color the organism’s fur should be.\nOne codes for black fur, and the other codes for white fur. Yet one member of the pair defi-\nnitely wins the debate, since the organism has black fur. When we want to describe this organ-\nism’s phenotype and genotype in terms of fur color we say\nGenotype: black/white (or Bb)\nPhenotype: black\nWhy does one of the chromosomes get to express itself in the organism’s phenotype while the other\none has to keep quiet? Here’s the answer: for the species to which this organism belongs, black fur\nis dominant, and white fur is recessive. That just means that if an organism of this species has one\nblack-fur chromosome and one white-fur chromosome, the organism will have fur that’s black. A\ndominant allele will always give rise to the phenotype. A recessive allele only gives rise to the pheno-\ntype when there are no dominant alleles to overshadow it.\n8.Genetics | 161\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nNotice that we can use a sort of “shorthand” to indicate genotype. We can use letters to represent\nthe alleles an organism has. For example, in our first organism, the one in which both chromosomes\ncode for black fur, we described the genotype as black/black, or BB. The uppercase B represents the\nallele for black fur because black is dominant. In our second organism, in which one chromosome\ncodes for black fur and one codes for white fur, we described the genotype as black/white, or Bb.\nThe lowercase b represents the allele for white fur.\nUppercase letters are used to represent domin. ant alleles, and lower‘c ase\nletters are used to represent recessive alleles.\nNotice also that the letter chosen to represent the dominant allele is the same letter chosen to\nrepresent the recessive allele. In other words, we didn’t switch letters and represent the allele\nfor white fur with a lowercase w. As long as we're talking about the same trait (in this case, fur\ncolor), the letter stays the same; we just use uppercase for dominant and lower case for recessive.\nLet’s consider a few more organisms of this species. Here’s one with fur color genotype: white/\nwhite.\nWhite fur White fur\nIts fur-color phenotype will be white. Even though white is recessive, both chromosomes agree\nthat the fur should be white. There’s no black-fur chromosome around to dominate the matter.\nAs a matter of fact, if you see an organism of this species and its fur is white, you know that\nits genotype is white/white, or bb. Because white is recessive, that’s the only genotype that can\nproduce a white phenotype. If a black-fur chromosome were around, the phenotype would have\nto be black. A white-fur phenotype definitely means a bb genotype because white is recessive.\nCodominance and Incomplete Dominance\nIt is possible, in the case of multiple alleles (i.e., more than two), for two alleles to exhibit codom-\ninance. This means that a heterozygote expresses both alleles. This is the case, for example, when\nsomeone has the blood type AB. Their blood cells have both types of proteins on them at the\nsame time instead of just having protein A or protein B. Neither is dominant.\nAnother special type of dominance is incomplete dominance. In this type, the dominant and\nrecessive alleles blend together and the phenotype is sort of an in-between version of them. An\nexample would be if a heterozygote has a red allele and a white allele and the flower phenotype\nturns out pink.\n162 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com"

      "reference_material_content": "U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nFact Sheet: Pregnancy\nDiscrimination\nThis technical assistance document was issued upon approval of the Chair of\nthe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nOLC Control EEOC-NVTA-0000-11\nNumber:\nConcise Display Fact Sheet: Pregnancy Discrimination\nName:\nIssue Date: 01-15-1997\nGeneral Topics: Sex/Pregnancy\nSummary: This document addresses information about pregnancy\ndiscrimination under Title VII, as amended by the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA).\nCitation: Title VII, 29 CFR Part 16\nDocument Employees, Employers, Applicants, HR Practitioners\nApplicant:\nPrevious No\nRevision:\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are\nnot meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to\nprovide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or\nagency policies.\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is an amendment to Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\nmedical conditions constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII. Women\naffected by pregnancy or related conditions must be treated in the same manner as\nother applicants or employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work.\nHiring and Working Conditions\nAn employer cannot refuse to hire a woman because of her pregnancy related\ncondition as long as she is able to perform the major functions of her job. An\nemployer cannot refuse to hire her because of its prejudices against pregnant\nworkers or because of the prejudices of co-workers, clients, or customers. The PDA\nalso forbids discrimination based on pregnancy when it comes to any other aspect\nof employment, including pay, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, fringe\nbenefits, firing, and any other term or condition of employment.\nPregnancy and Maternity Leave\nAn employer may not single out pregnancy related conditions for medical clearance\nprocedures that are not required of employees who are similar in their ability or\ninability to work. For example, if an employer requires its employees to submit a\ndoctor's statement concerning their inability to work before granting leave or\npaying sick benefits, the employer may require employees affected by pregnancy\nrelated conditions to do the same.\nPregnant employees must be permitted to work as long as they are able to perform\ntheir jobs. If an employee has been absent from work as a result of a pregnancy\nrelated condition and recovers, her employer may not require her to remain on\nleave until the baby's birth. Nor may an employer have a rule that prohibits an\nemployee from returning to work for a predetermined length of time after\nchildbirth.\nUnder the PDA, an employer that allows temporarily disabled employees to take\ndisability leave or leave without pay must allow an employee who is temporarily\n\ndisabled due to pregnancy to do the same. Employers must hold open a job for a\npregnancy related absence the same length of time that jobs are held open for\nemployees on sick or temporary disability leave.\nFurther, under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, enforced by the\nU.S. Department of Labor, a new parent (including foster and adoptive parents) may\nbe eligible for 12 weeks of leave (unpaid, or paid if the employee has earned or\naccrued it) that may be used for care of the new child. To be eligible, the employee\nmust have worked for the employer for 12 months prior to taking the leave and the\nemployer must have a specified number of employees. For more information\nplease see: www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm\n(http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm) .\nPregnancy and Temporary Disability\nIf an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job due to pregnancy, the\nemployer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled employee; for\nexample, by providing light duty, modified tasks, alternative assignments, disability\nleave, or leave without pay.\nAdditionally, impairments resulting from pregnancy (for example, gestational\ndiabetes) may be disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). An\nemployer may have to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability related\nto pregnancy, absent undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense). For\nexample, an employer may be required to provide modified duties for an employee\nwith a 20-pound lifting restriction stemming from pregnancy related sciatica, absent\nundue hardship. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 makes it much easier to show\nthat a medical condition is a covered disability. For more information about the\nADA, see https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination\n(https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-disability-related-resources) . For information\nabout the ADA Amendments Act, see https://www.eeoc.gov/regulations-related-\ndisability-discrimination (https://www.eeoc.gov/regulations-related-disability-\ndiscrimination) .\n\nHealth Insurance\nAny health insurance provided by an employer must cover expenses for pregnancy\nrelated conditions on the same basis as expenses for other medical conditions. The\nPDA specifies, however, that insurance coverage for expenses arising from abortion\nis not required, except where the life of the mother is endangered or medical\ncomplications arise from an abortion.\nPregnancy related expenses should be reimbursed in the same manner as those\nincurred for other medical conditions, whether payment is on a fixed basis or a\npercentage of reasonable and customary charge basis. The amounts payable by the\ninsurance provider can be limited only to the same extent as costs for other\nconditions. No additional or larger deductible can be imposed.\nUnder Title VII, benefits can be denied for medical costs arising from an existing\npregnancy if a health insurance plan excludes benefit payments for pre-existing\nconditions. Other laws, however, may apply to the coverage of pre-existing\nconditions.\nEmployers must provide the same level of health benefits for spouses of male\nemployees as they do for spouses of female employees.\nEqual Access to Benefits\nIf an employer provides any benefits to workers on medical leave, the employer\nmust provide the same benefits for those on medical leave for pregnancy related\nconditions.\nEmployees with pregnancy related disabilities must be treated the same as other\ntemporarily disabled employees for accrual and crediting of seniority, vacation\ncalculation, pay increases, and temporary disability benefits."

The deduction allows eligible\ntaxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of their QBI, plus 20 percent of\nqualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified\npublicly traded partnership (PTP) income. Income earned through a C\ncorporation or by providing services as an employee is not eligible for\nthe deduction. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or\nbusiness, see Determining your qualified trades or businesses in the\nInstructions for Form 8995-A or Form 8995.\nThe deduction is available regardless of whether taxpayers itemize\ndeductions on Schedule A or take the standard deduction. Eligible\ntaxpayers can claim the deduction for tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017, and ending on or before December 31, 2025.\n\nThe deduction has two components.\n1. QBI component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of QBI from a domestic business operated as a sole\nproprietorship or through a partnership, S corporation, trust, or\nestate. The QBI Component is subject to limitations, depending on\nthe taxpayer's taxable income which may include the type of trade\nor business, the amount of W-2 wages paid by the qualified trade or\nbusiness, and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition\n(UBIA) of qualified property held by the trade or business. It may\nalso be reduced by the patron reduction if the taxpayer is a patron\nof an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.\n2. REIT/PTP component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income. This\ncomponent is not limited by W-2 wages or the UBIA of qualified\nproperty. Depending on the taxpayer's taxable income, the amount\nof PTP income that qualifies may be limited depending on the type\nof the PTP's trade or business.\nThe deduction is limited to the lesser of the QBI component plus the\nREIT/PTP component or 20 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income\nminus net capital gain.\nQBI is the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction,\nand loss from any qualified trade or business, including income from\npartnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships, and certain trusts.\nGenerally, this includes, but is not limited to, the deductible part of\n\nself-employment tax, self-employed health insurance, and deductions\nfor contributions to qualified retirement plans (e.g., SEP, SIMPLE and\nqualified plan deductions).\nQBI does not include items such as:\nItems that are not properly includable in taxable income\nInvestment items such as capital gains or losses\nInterest income not properly allocable to a trade or business\nWage income\nIncome that is not effectively connected with the conduct of\nbusiness within the United States\nCommodities transactions or foreign currency gains or losses\nCertain dividends and payments in lieu of dividends\nIncome, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts\nAnnuities, unless received in connection with the trade or business\nAmounts received as reasonable compensation from an S\ncorporation\nAmounts received as guaranteed payments from a partnership\nPayments received by a partner for services other than in a capacity\nas a partner\nQualified REIT dividends\nPTP income\nSolely for the purposes of section 199A, a safe harbor is available to\nindividuals and owners of passthrough entities who seek to claim the\ndeduction under section 199A with respect to a rental real estate\nenterprise.

      "reference_material_content": "An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nNational Institutes of Health\nRelaxation Techniques: What You\nNeed To Know\nWhat are relaxation techniques?\nRelaxation techniques are practices to help bring about the body’s\n“relaxation response,” which is characterized by slower breathing,\nlower blood pressure, and a reduced heart rate. The relaxation\nresponse is the opposite of the stress response.\nSome of the studies discussed in this fact sheet compare relaxation\ntechniques to cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral ©Thinkstock\ntherapy is a type of psychological treatment that helps a person\nbecome aware of ways of thinking that may be automatic but are\ninaccurate and harmful. The therapy involves efforts to change\nthinking patterns and usually behavioral patterns as well.\nWhat are the different types of relaxation\ntechniques?\nListed below are some of the different types of relaxation techniques.\nProgressive Relaxation: Also called progressive muscle\nrelaxation, this technique involves tensing different muscles in\nyour body and then releasing the tension.\nAutogenic Training: Through a series of mental exercises\ninvolving relaxation and ideas you suggest to yourself\n(autosuggestion), your mind focuses on your body’s experience of\nrelaxation.\nGuided Imagery or “Visualization”: In guided imagery, you\npicture objects, scenes, or events that are associated with\nrelaxation or calmness and attempt to produce a similar feeling in\nyour body.\n\nBiofeedback-Assisted Relaxation: Through feedback that is\nusually provided by an electronic device, you learn how to\nrecognize and manage how your body responds. The electronic\ndevice lets you see how your heart rate, blood pressure, or\nmuscle tension changes in response to feeling stressed or\nrelaxed.\nSelf-Hypnosis: In self-hypnosis programs, people learn to\nproduce the relaxation response when prompted by a phrase or\nnonverbal cue (called a “suggestion”) of their own.\nBreathing Exercises: For breathing exercises, you might focus\non taking slow, deep breaths—also called diaphragmatic\nbreathing.\nOther complementary health practices such as massage therapy,\nmeditation, yoga, tai chi, and qigong can produce several beneficial\neffects in the body, including the relaxation response; however, these\npractices are not discussed in this fact sheet. For more detailed\ninformation on these practices, see “Massage Therapy: What You\nNeed To Know,” “Meditation,” “Yoga: What You Need To Know,” “Tai\nChi: In Depth,” and “Qigong: What You Need To Know.”\nHow popular are relaxation techniques?\nThe National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative U.S.\nsurvey, found that 6.4 percent of U.S. adults used guided imagery\nand/or progressive muscle relaxation in 2022; in 2002, only 3.8 percent\nused these techniques.\nCan relaxation techniques help during\nlabor and childbirth?\nMany women would like to use nondrug options for pain relief during\nlabor and childbirth.\nA 2018 review included 5 studies (total of 1,248 participants) that\nused various relaxation techniques and measured women’s pain\nintensity during labor. Overall, the studies found that relaxation\ntechniques might help women manage labor pain, but the quality\nof the research varied between low and very low. Also, because\ndifferent relaxation techniques were used, it’s hard to say which\nspecific techniques might help.\n\nA 2019 review compared women’s views and experiences of\nusing pain medicine (epidurals, opioids) and nondrug methods\n(relaxation, massage) for pain relief options during labor and\nchildbirth. Eight studies (99 women) looked at relaxation. The\noverall findings showed mixed experiences for both methods of\npain relief. Some women who used the nondrug methods\nreported that they were less effective than anticipated.\nCan children and adolescents benefit\nfrom relaxation techniques?\nSome relaxation techniques may help children and adolescents with\npain, anxiety and depression, headaches, or difficulty with needle-\nrelated procedures. But much of the supporting research was rated as\nlow quality, so we don’t have a completely clear picture yet of the\npossible benefits.\nPain\nA 2017 review on recurrent abdominal pain in children and\nadolescents found that guided imagery and hypnotherapy may\nbe helpful in reducing pain in the short term, but the quality of the\nresearch was low. The review included 2 small studies on guided\nimagery and 2 small studies on practitioner-led hypnotherapy\n(plus homework), with a total of 146 participants.\nA 2019 review of 10 studies with 697 participants looked at the\neffect that remotely delivered psychological therapies had on\nchronic pain in children and adolescents. Nine of the studies\nincluded a relaxation component in the treatment. “Remotely\ndelivered” meant flexible, self-guided treatments that were\ntypically internet-based and didn’t usually involve contact with a\nclinician. The review found that psychological therapies delivered\nremotely were helpful at reducing headache pain right after\ntreatment but not later at follow up. No benefit was found for the\nother types of pain that were studied. Overall, the research was\nconsidered to be of very low quality.\n\nHeadache\nA 2019 review of 7 studies involving 571 children looked at the\neffects of relaxation training on migraine headaches, tension-\ntype headache, or both. Although some studies reported\ndecreased headache frequency, duration, and intensity after\nrelaxation training, other studies did not. Overall, the results were\ninconsistent, and the research was of very low quality.\nA 2016 review of 5 studies involving 137 children and adolescents\nfound that biofeedback seemed to be helpful with migraines,\nespecially with reducing their frequency. The number of\nparticipants in the studies, however, was small.\nA 2019 review indicated that self-relaxation, biofeedback, and\nself-hypnosis may be reasonable alternatives to using medicine\nin managing childhood migraine, particularly in adolescents.\nAccording to this review, however, some of the best evidence\nseen in any pediatric migraine therapy study has been for\ncognitive behavioral therapy added to treatment with standard\nantimigraine medicines.\nCan relaxation techniques lower blood\npressure?\nHigh blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, such as\nheart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. Having a healthy\nlifestyle can help to prevent high blood pressure. One part of a healthy\nlifestyle is learning how to relax and manage stress.\n\nA 2019 review of 17 studies involving 1,165 participants indicated\nthat slow breathing exercises led to a modest reduction in blood\npressure and may be a reasonable first treatment for people with\nprehypertension or low-risk high blood pressure. The studies in\nthis review, however, differed in how they were done and had\nshort follow-up periods and high risk of bias. Also, the studies\ndidn’t look at whether slow breathing exercises ultimately\ninfluenced health outcomes, such as stroke or heart attack.\nA 2018 review found that relaxation therapies and biofeedback\nmight be helpful for reducing blood pressure, but only weak\nrecommendations were made for their use because the quality of\ndata from the 29 studies ranged from low to very low.\nIf you have high blood pressure, it’s important to follow the\ntreatment plan prescribed by your health care provider. Following\nyour treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay\nserious complications of high blood pressure. If you’re\nconsidering a complementary or integrative approach for your\nhigh blood pressure, discuss it with your health care provider."

Depending on where you live, this\ncap may be even lower. See the chart on the next page for the statewide cap that applies where you live.\nWhen raising your rent, your landlord must provide formal written notice — a call, text, or email is not\nenough — at least 30 days before the increase can take effect. If the rent is more than 10%, your landlord\nmust provide notice at least 90 days before the increase can take effect.\nYou can only be evicted by court order. It is illegal for a landlord to lock you out, shut off your utilities,\nor put your things out on the curb to try to force you out. If you get an eviction notice, get legal help\nright away. If your landlord files for eviction in court and you fail to respond, the court may order eviction\nwithout waiting for you.\nYou can generally only be evicted for “just cause.” This does not apply if you lived somewhere for less than\na year or to some types of housing, such as housing built in the last 15 years. (Civil Code § 1946.2.) Just\ncause includes:\n• Not paying rent\n• Breaking a material term of your lease\n• Committing nuisance or waste, or using the premises for unlawful purposes\n• Engaging in criminal activity on the premises or directed at your landlord\n• Refusing to allow lawful entry to the premises\n• Refusing to sign a new lease that contains similar terms to your existing lease\n• The owner is withdrawing the unit from the rental market, moving into the unit, demolishing or\nsubstantially remodeling the unit, or complying with a law or order that requires you to leave.\nYour landlord must repair health and safety issues. For example, they must provide safe and working\nplumbing and heating, and keep the premises free from roaches and rats. If there is a health or safety\nissue, ask your landlord in writing to repair it, and keep copies of your requests.\nYour landlord must return your security deposit. Your landlord must itemize any deductions from your\nsecurity deposit within 21 days of you moving out. Deductions can be made for things like unpaid rent,\ncleaning, and repairing damage beyond ordinary wear and tear.\nYour landlord must provide reasonable accommodations if you have a disability. Your landlord must also\nallow you to make reasonable physical modifications to your rental unit.\nYour landlord cannot discriminate against you. Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual\norientation, disability status, marital status, income source, veteran status, or certain other characteristics\nis illegal.\nYour landlord may not retaliate against you for exercising your tenant rights. Your landlord also cannot\nthreaten to disclose your immigration status to pressure you to move out, or harass or retaliate against you\nby disclosing your immigration status to law enforcement.\nYou may have additional rights. You may have additional rights under local rent control, rent stabilization,\nor just cause eviction laws. Check what rules are in place where you live by visit your local government’s\nwebsite.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\nGet legal help as soon as possible if you believe your landlord has violated your tenant rights or if you’re\nfacing eviction. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free or low-cost legal aid. To find a legal\naid office near where you live, visit LawHelpCA.org. Then click on the tab in the middle of the page that\nsays “Find Legal Help,” and enter your county. If you do not qualify for legal aid and need help finding a\nlawyer, visit the California State Bar webpage to find a local certified lawyer service, or visit the California\nCourts’ webpage for tenants facing evictions.\nFor more information and resources, visit www.oag.ca.gov/housing.\nStatewide Rent-Increase Caps Under the California Tenant Protection Act Through July 31, 2026\nThe California Tenant Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2020, limits how much your landlord\nmay increase your rent over any 12-month period. Rent increases are capped at “5% plus the percentage\nchange in the cost of living,” with a maximum annual rent increase of 10%. How much your rent can\nbe increased depends on where you live and when the rent increase takes effect. For convenience, this\nchart shows the maximum rent increase currently allowed under the Tenant Protection Act. This chart is\ninformational only; the maximum allowable rent increase is governed by Civil Code section 1947.12(a).\nIncrease starts between Increase starts between\nArea1\n8/1/24 and 7/31/25 8/1/25 and 7/31/26\nLos Angeles Area:\n• Los Angeles County 8.9% 8%\n• Orange County\nRiverside Area:\n• Riverside County 9.3% 7.5%\n• San Bernardino County\nSan Diego Area:\n8.6% 8.8%\n• San Diego County\nSan Francisco Area:\n• Alameda County\n• Contra Costa County\n8.8% 6.3%\n• Marin County\n• San Francisco County\n• San Mateo County\nAll Other Counties 8.8% 7.7%\nFor rent increases taking effect before or after the dates shown above, please see Civil Code section\n1947.12.\n1 The change in the cost of living is measured using April Consumer Price Index information published by the U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics for the Los Angeles Area, Riverside Area, San Francisco Area, and San Diego Area. For all other\ncounties, the change in the cost of living is measured using April California Consumer Price Index information published\nby the California Department of Industrial Relations. If no April data is available, March data is used.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\nThese rent-increase caps apply to most rental housing2 in California that is more than 15 years old,\nincluding single-family homes and condos owned by corporations, mobilehomes rented from mobilehome\npark management, and housing rented by Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher recipients.\nIn addition to this statewide cap, your city or county may have stronger rent-control laws. Check your city’s\nand county’s webpages and other local resources to see whether there are other rent-increase protections\nwhere you live. If you believe that you have been the victim of an unlawful rent increase, seek legal\nassistance immediately.\n2 The rent-increase cap does not apply to mobilehome owners or to the following types of homes:\n• Units built within the last 15 years (calculated on a rolling basis);\n• Units restricted by deed, regulatory restriction, or other recorded document as affordable housing for very\nlow, low, or moderate-income households, or that are subject to an agreement providing housing subsidies for\naffordable housing for those households;\n• Dormitories owned and operated by institutions of higher education or other schools;\n• Units subject to a more restrictive rent cap;\n• A two-unit property within a single structure, where the property owner lives in one unit during the entire\ntenancy; and\n• Single-family homes and condominiums(a) that are not owned by a real estate investment trust, a corporation,\nan LLC with at least one corporate member, or management of a mobilehome park; AND (b) where the landlord\nnotified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the Tenant Protection Act’s rent limits or “just\ncause” requirements.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General"

For example, your landlord must provide:\no Working plumbing, including hot and cold water and sewage disposal.\no Safe and working electrical equipment and wiring, including lighting.\no Heating.\no Walls and roofs that keep out rain and wind.\no Unbroken windows and doors, with working locks.\no Working smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors.\no Safe fire or emergency exits.\no Adequate pest control for rodents (like rats) and insects (like roaches and bed bugs).\no Adequate sanitation, including enough trash cans, and clean common areas.\no Floors, stairways, and railings in good repair.\no Repairs to prevent and fix health hazards, such as fire hazards, visible mold, or dampness.\n• You may be responsible for any damage you cause to the home. Tenants must keep their homes sanitary, use appliances as\nintended, and avoid damaging the home. If you damage the home, your landlord may be able to charge you for repairs.\n• You have a right to ask your landlord to repair any unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Request repairs in writing, such as by\ntext message, email, or letter. Keep copies or take photos of all requests for repairs and all communications that you have\nwith your landlord about these repairs. If possible, take videos or photos that show the unsafe or unhealthy conditions.\n• If your landlord refuses to make repairs, seek help right away. Tell your local code enforcement office, local building\ndepartment, or local health department about any unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The city or county should inspect your\nhome and require your landlord to repair any violations that it finds. If you are not sure what agency to call, you can call 211\nor 311 in some cities. You can also seek legal help. See below on how to get legal help.\n• Your landlord may not retaliate against you for seeking repairs. You have a right to ask for repairs, to report health and\nsafety issues to government agencies, and to seek legal help. Your landlord cannot retaliate against you for doing so. Your\nlandlord also cannot threaten to disclose your immigration status to pressure you to move out, or harass or retaliate against\nyou by disclosing your immigration status to law enforcement. (Civil Code, § 1942.5.)\n• You may be entitled to relocation assistance. If the conditions are so bad that your immediate health or safety is in danger,\nthe city or county may make you leave the property immediately. The city or county may also require your landlord to pay\nfor you to relocate to a new home. If you receive a notice from the city or county requiring you to leave your home, ask the\ncode enforcement office about these benefits immediately. (Health & Safety Code, § 17975.)\n• Withholding rent may put you at risk of eviction. If your landlord refuses to make repairs, seek legal help before deciding\nwhether to stop paying rent. Although you may be able to pay for the repair and deduct the cost from your rent, you must\nmeet certain requirements before doing so or it may put you at risk of eviction. (Civil Code, §§ 1942, 1942.5) If you receive\nan eviction notice, it is very important for you to tell your lawyer or the court about any health and safety issues in your\nhome. Provide them with photos or other proof of the problems, such as any documents you received from the city or\ncounty, and of your requests for repairs. (Civil Code, §§ 1942.3, 1942.4; Code of Civil Procedure, § 1174.2.)\nGet legal help as soon as possible if you believe your landlord has violated your tenant rights or if you’re facing eviction.\nIf you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free or low-cost legal aid. To find a legal aid office near where you live, visit\nLawHelpCA.1 Then click on the tab in the middle of the page that says “Find Legal Help,” and enter your county. If you do not\nqualify for legal aid and need help finding a lawyer, visit the California State Bar webpage2 to find a local certified lawyer referral\nservice, or visit the California Courts’ webpage3 for tenants facing evictions.\nFor more information and resources, visit www.oag.ca.gov/housing.\n1 www.lawhelpca.org/issues/housing/landlord-and-tenant-issues\n2 www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Need-Legal-Help/Using-a-Certified-Lawyer-Referral-Service\n3 www.selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/eviction-tenant\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General"

(Civ. Code, § 1950.5.) Knowing the rules can help tenants protect their hard-earned money.\n• Security deposits are refundable. A security deposit belongs to the tenant, but the landlord is allowed to hold\non to it until the tenant moves out. If a landlord sells the property, the landlord must either return the deposit or\ngive it to the new owner to hold on to. By law, security deposits must be returned when the tenant moves out,\nminus allowed expenses.\n• The law limits the amount of security deposits.\nUntil July 1, 2024, the limit is two times the monthly rent (or, for furnished units, three times the\no\nrent).\nAfter July 1, 2024, the limit is one month’s rent. For landlords who own no more than two residential\no\nrental properties that collectively include no more than four total units for rent, the limit is two times\nthe monthly rent, but only if the landlord is a natural person or a limited liability company in which\nall members are natural persons.\n• Landlords can only use security deposits for the following specified expenses:\nPast-due rent.\no\nThe cost of repairing damages caused by tenants or their guests, not including ordinary wear and\no\ntear.\nThe cost of cleaning the property so that it is as clean as when the tenant first moved in.\no\nThe cost of replacing or restoring the landlord’s personal property, such as furniture, but only if the\no\nrental agreement says this is allowed.\n• Security deposits MAY NOT be used for other costs, such as (1) damages that were already there when the\ntenant moved in; (2) unreasonable or unnecessary expenses; or (3) ordinary wear and tear.\n• Take advantage of the right to an inspection before move-out. After learning that a tenant plans to move,\nlandlords must notify tenants of the right to ask for an initial inspection so that the tenant has a chance to fix any\nissues and avoid charges. If the tenant asks for an inspection, it must happen within the two weeks before the\ntenant moves out.\nThe tenant has the right to be there during the inspection.\no\nThe landlord must identify the damages the landlord intends to deduct from the security deposit and\no\ngive the tenant an itemized statement so that the tenant has a chance to fix the problems before\ngetting charged.\n• Within 21 days after move-out, the landlord must send the tenant an itemized statement explaining in detail any\ndeductions from the security deposit (unless they total less than $125), and return the rest of the deposit.\nIf the landlord did the repairs, the statement must show the work done, the time spent, and the\no\nhourly rate.\nIf someone else did the work, the landlord must provide a copy of the bill for the work.\no\nIf the work cannot be finished in 21 days, the statement must give a good faith cost estimate. The\no\nlandlord must then provide the final statement and return the remaining deposit within 14 days of\nfinishing work.\n• Check local city or county rules, which may have more tenant protections or landlord requirements. For\nexample, some cities make landlords pay interest on security deposits.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\n• Additional protections apply to service members. If you are a service member, you may be entitled to lower\nsecurity deposits and certain eviction protections. Ask your base legal office for help. For the legal office’s contact\ninformation, ask your command or visit legalassistance.law.af.mil.\n• Landlords can face penalties for breaking the security deposit laws.\nIf a tenant files a court case claiming the security deposit laws were violated, the landlord has to\no\nprove that the amounts deducted were reasonable. If the landlord acted in bad faith, courts can\naward the tenant his or her actual loss plus up to twice the amount of the deposit.\nGet help from a lawyer!

      "reference_material_content": "Consumer Resource Center\nYour Business, Your Deposits\nVea esta página en español (https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-\ncenter/2024-05/su-negocio-y-sus-depositos)\nThings to know about small\nbusiness accounts\nYour small business may need a variety of deposit services or\nproducts. As a small business owner, you may be juggling the\nexpenses of running the day-to-day operations of your business, the\ncosts of expanding your business, and the responsibilities to protect\nyour employees and your customers with your financial choices.\nKnowing you have all of that on your mind, here is some helpful\ninformation and some things to consider about banking for your\nbusiness.\nPayments from your customers\nAs a small business owner, you will need to decide how customers will\npay you. Whether or not to accept debit or credit card payments is an\nimportant decision to make. While these forms of payment are\nconvenient for customers, you may choose not to accept debit or\ncredit cards because of the fees and other costs. You may allow\ncustomers to pay using mobile apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/june2020.html).\nMake sure you carefully read the fine print of any mobile app you’re\nconsidering, so that you are aware of any fees and limitations on\nfunds availability.\nIn general, you will want to comparison shop for a mobile app or debit\nand credit card processing service, since costs and other terms and\nconditions will vary.\n\nDeciding on whether to separate your consumer and business deposit\naccounts\nKeeping your business accounts separate from your personal\naccounts has some benefits. Also, the need for separate accounts\ngenerally increases as a business grows or becomes complex.\nAll deposits owned by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated\nassociation at the same bank are added together and insured up to\n$250,000, separately from the personal accounts\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-\nproducts-insured/) of the owners or members. Note, however, that\ndeposits of a sole proprietorship are aggregated with the owner’s\nother deposits held in his/her name only.\nKeeping your business funds separate from your personal funds,\nsuch as in a business account, may limit personal liability. The\nseparation allows authorized employees to handle day-to-day\nbusiness banking tasks without those employees being involved in\nyour personal finances.\nThe\nInternal Revenue Service (PDF) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-\npdf/p583.pdf)\nalso recommends that you have a business checking account that is\nseparate from your personal accounts. One reason is because doing\nso can make recordkeeping for tax time easier.\nBusiness accounts make it possible for customers to pay with credit\ncards or use checks made out to your business. Remember, if you\ncollect and retain certain customer data, there may be legal\nrequirements to protect it.\nFor more information about what types of accounts are insured by the\nFDIC, please visit: Are My Deposits Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\n\ninsured)\nProtections may vary for consumer versus commercial accounts\nYour liability for unauthorized transactions on your personal debit\ncard accounts is generally capped by federal regulations — $50 or\nmore for debit cards (depending on when you notify the bank). While\nfederal law doesn't protect business debit cards from liability for\nunauthorized transactions, your bank account agreement and state\nlaws could limit your liability. The bottom line: Notify your bank\nimmediately of any problems because state laws, industry standards\nand your deposit agreements may provide\nprotections (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/bank-\naccounts/answers/know-your-rights/)\n.\nWatch out for scams targeting your business\nScammers are out there and will do what they can to exploit your\nbusiness perhaps by stealing information about customers or\nunauthorized withdrawals from a bank account as well as fraudulent\noffers and counterfeit bills. Also, here are a few scams to watch out\nfor, so you can protect your business and your money.\nRansomware is a type of malware created to lock or encrypt files on\nan electronic device like a smart phone or computer. The sender of\nthe ransomware then demands a ransom—generally in the form of a\ndigital asset—in exchange for unlocking or decrypting the information\non your electronic device. The scammer typically threatens to\npublically disclose or sell the compromised information, if the ransom\nis not paid. If you believe your business is a victim of a ransomware\nattack, contact law enforcement immediately. You can also contact a\nlocal field office of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-\nsafety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\nor\n\nU.S. Secret Service (PDF)\n(https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2020-\n12/Preparing%20for%20a%20Cyber%20Incident%20-\n%20A%20Guide%20to%20Ransomware%20v%201.0.pdf)\nto report a ransomware attack and ask for assistance.\nPhishing is a term for scams commonly used when a criminal uses\nemail to ask you to provide personal financial information or financial\ninformation of the small business. The sender pretends to be from a\nbank, a retail store, or government agency and makes the email\nappear legitimate. The approach is often threatening or appears\nurgent in nature. Do not open links or provide financial information\nunless you are sure of the party who is interacting with you. Smishing\nis similar to phishing, but instead of using email, the criminal uses text\nmessaging to reach you.\nVishing, similar to phishing and smishing, is when scammers use\nphone services such as a live phone call, a “robocall,” or a voicemail to\ntry to trick you into providing personal or business information by\nsounding like a legitimate business or government official.\nTo summarize, making sure you choose the right bank for the deposit\nservices or products that you need for your business is really\nimportant. Separating your personal accounts from your business\ndeposit accounts is not only a practical way to run your business, it\nmay also be more efficient. Lastly, stay on the lookout for scams to\nhelp protect your business and customers’ interests.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News: Need a Loan for Your New Small Business?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2023-05/need-loan-\nyour-new-small-business)\n\nFDIC: Money Smart for Small Business\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/money-smart-small-\nbusiness)\nFDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-\ndeposit-insurance)\nSmall Business Administration (SBA):\nOpen a business bank account (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/launch-your-business/open-business-bank-account)\nSBA:\nStrengthen your cybersecurity (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/manage-your-business/strengthen-your-cybersecurity)\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency:\nStopRansomeware.gov (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\nFor more consumer resources, visit FDIC.gov (https://www.fdic.gov/) ,\nor go to the FDIC Knowledge Center\n(https://ask.fdic.gov/fdicinformationandsupportcenter/s/public-\ninformation?language=en_US).

      "reference_material_content": "The Uniformed And Overseas Citizens\nAbsentee Voting Act\nThe Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) was\nenacted by Congress in 1986. UOCAVA requires that the states and\nterritories allow certain groups of citizens to register and vote absentee in\nelections for Federal offices. In addition, most states and territories have\ntheir own laws allowing citizens covered by UOCAVA to register and vote\nabsentee in state and local elections as well.\nProvisions of UOCAVA\nUnited States citizens covered by UOCAVA include:\n•\nmembers of the United States Uniformed Services and merchant\nmarine;\n•\ntheir family members; and\n•\nUnited States citizens residing outside the United States.\nAmong its key provisions, UOCAVA provides for an application called the\nFederal Post Card Application that qualified servicemembers and\n\noverseas citizens can use to register to vote and request an absentee\nballot simultaneously. The law also allows for the use of a \"back-up\" ballot\nfor federal offices, called the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. This ballot\nmay be cast by voters covered by the Act who have made timely\napplication for, but have not received, their regular ballot from their state\nor territory, subject to certain conditions.\nIn 2009, a subtitle of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal\nYear 2010, titled the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act\n(\"MOVE Act\"), amended UOCAVA to establish new voter registration and\nabsentee ballot procedures which states must follow in all federal\nelections. The amended UOCAVA is available here.\nMost of these new procedures were implemented by the November 2010\ngeneral election. As amended by the MOVE Act, UOCAVA now requires\nstate officials to:\n•\nprovide UOCAVA voters with an option to request and receive voter\nregistration and absentee ballot applications by electronic\ntransmissions and establish electronic transmission options for\ndelivery of blank absentee ballots to UOCAVA voters;\n•\ntransmit validly-requested absentee ballots to UOCAVA voters no later\nthan 45 days before an election for a federal office, when the request\nhas been received by that date, except where an undue hardship\nwaiver is approved by the Department of Defense for that election;\n•\ntake steps to ensure that electronic transmission procedures protect\nthe security of the balloting process and the privacy of the identity and\npersonal data of UOCAVA voters using the procedures;\n•\nexpand the acceptance of the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot to all\nelections for federal office beginning December 31, 2010;\n•\naccept otherwise valid voter registration applications, absentee ballot\napplications, voted ballots, or Federal Write-In Absentee Ballots\nwithout regard to state notarization requirements, or restrictions on\npaper type, or envelope type; and\n•\nallow UOCAVA voters to track the receipt of their absentee ballots\nthrough a free access system.\n\nAdministration of UOCAVA\nThe Secretary of Defense has administrative responsibilities for UOCAVA.\nWithin the Department of Defense, the Secretary has assigned these\nresponsibilities to the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP). The\nFVAP actively monitors the voter registration and absentee voting\nopportunities provided to members of the Armed Forces, their family\nmembers, and U.S. citizens residing overseas. It works closely with the\nStates to assure that citizens covered by UOCAVA have a full opportunity\nto participate in Federal elections.\nThe FVAP maintains a website where you will find detailed information\nabout overseas voting procedures and materials, including instructions for\nobtaining and using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and the\nFederal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). The website also provides\ninformation about using the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho does UOCAVA protect?\nThe protections of UOCAVA apply to: (1) members of the uniformed\nservices on active duty and the merchant marine who, because of their\nmembership in the service, are absent from their place of residence, and\n\nare otherwise qualified to vote; (2) the spouses and dependents of these\nuniformed services voters who are absent due to the member's active duty\nor service and (3) qualified voters who reside outside of the United States.\nWhat rights does UOCAVA give me?\nIf you are a qualified voter protected by UOCAVA, in elections for federal\noffice, the state in which you are qualified to vote must (1) permit you to\nregister to vote and request an absentee ballot if a request is received by\nthe 30th day before the election; (2) send you an absentee ballot early\nenough to receive it, vote it, and send it back, specifically by the 45th day\nbefore the election, if a request is received by that date; (3) permit you to\nrequest and receive your voter registration form, absentee ballot request,\nand blank absentee ballot electronically; (4) permit you to cast a Federal\nWrite-In Absentee Ballot under certain conditions; (5) provide you with\nfree access to a tracking system that tells you whether your ballot has\nbeen received by the appropriate state election official; and (6) accept\notherwise-valid voted ballots even if they are not notarized, and even if\nthey are printed on a nonstandard paper size or sent in a nonstandard type\nenvelope.\nWhat is a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)?\nThe Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) is an official blank write-in\nballot that all UOCAVA voters can use as an emergency “back-up” ballot if\nthey have made a timely request for an absentee ballot from the state or\ncounty but do not receive it in time to send it back by their state's\ndeadline. UOCAVA requires states to accept FWABs in all elections for\nfederal office. If a UOCAVA voter receives a state-issued ballot after\nhaving already sent in a FWAB, the FVAP recommends that the voter vote\nthat ballot and send it in. A state will only count one of the ballots. You can\nfind more information on obtaining and voting a FWAB on the FVAP\nwebsite.\nIf a county is late in mailing absentee ballots to soldiers or U.S. citizens\nliving overseas, what can the Department of Justice do?\n\nUnder Section 105 of UOCAVA, the Attorney General is authorized to bring\ncivil actions to enforce UOCAVA requirements. When states have failed to\nmake sure that ballots are sent to qualified UOCAVA protected voters in a\ntimely manner, the Department of Justice has successfully obtained court\norders and consent decrees. Many of these have required states to extend\ntheir deadlines for receiving these ballots and to count such ballots, even\nwhen they arrived after Election Day. In some cases, the states were\nrequired to make permanent changes to their laws or procedures to make\nsure the problems are not repeated in future elections. Through these\ncases brought to enforce the federal law, the Department has ensured\nthat qualified servicemembers and overseas voters were able to cast their\nballots, and know that they were counted.\nWho can I contact if I have a question about my right to vote?\nThe FVAP administers many of the federal responsibilities under UOCAVA,\nand assists servicemembers, their families and overseas voters to\nfacilitate their participation in the voting process. If you need assistance\nin registering or voting under UOCAVA, you can contact FVAP. If you\nbelieve you have been denied any of the rights guaranteed by UOCAVA,\nyou can contact the Department of Justice."

      "reference_material_content": "Fact Sheet: Protecting Against Voter Intimidation\nIs voter intimidation illegal?\nYes. The right of each voter to cast his or her ballot free from intimidation or coercion is a foundational principle of\na free and democratic society. Federal law prohibits voter intimidation.\nMultiple federal statutes make it a crime to intimidate voters: it is illegal to intimidate, threaten, or coerce a person, or\nattempt to do so, “for the purpose of interfering with” that person’s right “to vote or to vote as he may choose.” 18\nU.S.C. § 594. It is also a crime to knowingly and willfully intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person, or attempt to do\nso, for “registering to vote, or voting,” or for “urging or aiding” anyone to vote or register to vote. 52\nU.S.C. § 20511(1). And it is a crime to “by force or threat of force” willfully injure, intimidate, or interfere with any\nperson because he or she is voting or has voted or “in order to intimidate” anyone from voting. 18\nU.S.C. § 245(b)(1)(A).\nFederal law also provides for civil lawsuits based on voter intimidation. Section 11 of the Voting Rights Act makes it\nunlawful to “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” another person, or attempt to do so, “for voting or attempting to vote”\nor “for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b). And Section 2 of the Ku Klux\nKlan Act of 1871 makes it unlawful for “two or more persons to conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat,”\nany voter from casting a ballot for the candidate of his or her choice. 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).\nEvery state also separately prohibits interference with voters and/or voter intimidation.\nWhat are examples of voter intimidation?\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has explained that voter intimidation is conduct that is intended to compel prospective\nvoters to vote against their preferences, or to not vote at all, through activity that is reasonably calculated to instill\nfear. Some actions that ordinarily would be legal may be unlawful if they are intended to intimidate voters.\nVoter intimidation is often subtle and context-dependent, so it can be difficult to identify in advance. Here are some\nexamples of conduct near polling sites that likely would constitute illegal voter intimidation, although other conduct\ncould also qualify:\n• Violent behavior inside or outside the polling • Verbal threats of violence\nsite\n• Confronting voters while wearing military-style • Spreading false information about voter fraud,\nor official-looking uniforms voting requirements, or related criminal\npenalties\n• Brandishing firearms or the intimidating display • Aggressively approaching voters’ vehicles or\nof firearms writing down voters’ license plate numbers\n• Following voters to, from, or within the polling • Harassing voters, aggressively questioning them\nplace about their qualifications to vote.\nAre guns permitted at polling places?\nSometimes. As the Giffords Law Center explains, states including Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,\nTexas, and the District of Columbia uniformly prohibit guns at polling places, while other states such as Colorado,\nIllinois, New Mexico, and Washington allow concealed weapons at polling places, but prohibit open carrying of\n\nfirearms there. Guns may also be prohibited when polling locations are in K–12 schools or on other property where\nfirearms are not permitted. The Supreme Court has “assume[d] it settled” that firearms can be banned at polling\nplaces. New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 30 (2022).\nEven where guns are not explicitly prohibited, they may not be used to intimidate voters. Nor may armed groups of\nindividuals patrol polling locations or otherwise engage in activities reserved for law enforcement or official state\nmilitias. Fact sheets containing state laws banning private unauthorized militia activity are available at\nhttp://bit.ly/50factsheets.\nDoes the First Amendment protect intimidating speech?\nNot always. The First Amendment does not protect intimidation in the form of “true threats,” “where the speaker\nmeans to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence” against another\nperson or group. Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 360 (2003). Some courts have held that threats of adverse legal,\neconomic, or immigration consequences are also unprotected when directed at voters. For further guidance on this\ntopic, see ICAP’s Fact Sheet: True Threats and the First Amendment.\nEven when speech is not openly threatening, states and localities nonetheless may impose some restrictions on speech\nin order to protect the integrity of elections and the rights of voters to cast their ballots free from intimidation. In\nBurson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992), the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that banned campaigning within\n100 feet of the entrance to a polling place. Nearly every state has a similar law protecting voters against electioneering\nin the immediate vicinity of the polls. Although speech outside this limited distance may be entitled to greater\nprotections, jurisdictions likely could, for example, require any demonstrations to remain a reasonable distance away\nfrom the path that voters must take into the polling place in order to guard against intimidation.\nWhat does it mean to be a poll watcher?\nState law regulates those who are permitted to observe the voting process within a polling place, sometimes called\n“poll watchers” or “election observers,” and what those observers are permitted to do. State law also governs who\nis permitted to challenge a voter’s qualifications to vote and what a challenger must show to make such a\nchallenge. These laws vary from state to state. Election officials should be familiar with these laws to prevent\nunauthorized observation or challenges and to ensure that such activities are not used for purposes of intimidation.\nEven if your qualifications to vote are challenged, you may still cast a regular ballot unless that challenge is sustained,\nand, at a minimum, you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot before leaving the polling site.\nWhat should I do if I see or experience voter intimidation?\n✓ If you fear imminent violence, call 9-1-1.\n✓ Notify your local election official at your polling place.\n✓ Document what you saw or experienced: what happened, where, and when, and\nwhether any voters were deterred from voting.\n✓ Call Election Protection at 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683). Assistance is also available\nin Spanish at 888-VE-Y-VOTA (888- 839-8682), in Arabic at 844-YALLA-US\n(844-915-5187), and Asian languages at 888-API-VOTE (1-888-274-8683). A video\nAmerican Sign Language line is available at 301-818-VOTE (301-818-8683).\nThis guidance was prepared by the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP) at Georgetown University Law Center. ICAP’s\nmission is to use strategic legal advocacy to defend constitutional rights and values, while working to restore confidence in the integrity of governmental\ninstitutions.

The Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) sets federal limits on how much can be garnished and provides job protection for workers. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about wage garnishment protections, including calculation thresholds, different rules for different debt types, and how various forms of compensation are treated. |\n| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about wage garnishment protection under the CCPA to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the specific dollar thresholds and percentages for garnishment limits, how child support garnishments differ from ordinary debt garnishments, and how tips and lump-sum payments are treated as earnings, so pay attention to these details. |\n| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about wage garnishment protection, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine the maximum garnishment amount when someone's income falls between the protected threshold and the 25% limit. 2. How to calculate garnishment limits for child support when the worker has different family situations or is behind on payments. 3.

      "reference_material_content": "WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\nFact Sheet #30: Wage Garnishment Protections of the\nConsumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA)\nDecember 2024\nThis fact sheet provides general information concerning the CCPA’s limits on the amount that employers may withhold from a person’s\nearnings in response to a garnishment order, and the CCPA’s protection from termination because of garnishment for any single debt.\nWage Garnishments\nA wage garnishment is any legal or equitable procedure through which some portion of a person’s earnings is required to be withheld for the\npayment of a debt. Most garnishments are made by court order. Other types of legal or equitable procedures for garnishment include IRS or\nstate tax collection agency levies for unpaid taxes and federal agency administrative garnishments for non-tax debts owed to the federal\ngovernment.\nWage garnishments do not include voluntary wage assignments – that is, situations in which employees voluntarily agree that their\nemployers may turn over some specified amount of their earnings to a creditor or creditors.\nLimitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe CCPA limits the amount of an individual’s earnings that may be garnished and protects an employee from being fired if pay is garnished\nfor only one debt. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division administers the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, which\napply in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories and possessions. The wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA protect\neveryone who receives personal earnings.\nThe Wage and Hour Division has authority to enforce against employers the limits on the amount that may be garnished and the protections\nfrom termination because of garnishment for any single debt. Questions relating to other garnishment issues should be directed to the court\nor agency initiating the garnishment action. For example, questions regarding the priority given to certain garnishments over others are not\nmatters covered by the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA and may be referred to the court or agency initiating the action. The CCPA\ncontains no provisions controlling the priorities of garnishments, which are determined by state or other federal laws. However, in no event\nmay the amount of any individual’s disposable earnings that may be garnished exceed the percentages specified in the CCPA (see below for\nmore information).\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings that may be Garnished (General)\nThe amount of pay subject to garnishment is based on an employee’s “disposable earnings,” which is the amount of earnings left after\nlegally required deductions are made. Examples of such deductions include federal, state, and local taxes, and the employee’s share of\nSocial Security, Medicare and State Unemployment Insurance tax. It also includes withholdings for employee retirement systems required by\nlaw.\nDeductions not required by law – such as those for voluntary wage assignments, union dues, health and life insurance, contributions to\ncharitable causes, purchases of savings bonds, retirement plan contributions (except those required by law) and payments to employers for\npayroll advances or purchases of merchandise – usually may not be subtracted from gross earnings when calculating disposable earnings\nunder the CCPA.\n\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA set the maximum amount that may be garnished in any workweek or pay period, regardless of\nthe number of garnishment orders received by the employer. For ordinary garnishments (i.e., those not for support, bankruptcy, or any state\nor federal tax), the weekly amount may not exceed the lesser of two figures: 25% of the employee’s disposable earnings, or the amount by\nwhich an employee’s disposable earnings are greater than 30 times the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 an hour).\nTherefore, if the pay period is weekly and disposable earnings are $217.50 ($7.25 × 30) or less, there can be no garnishment. If disposable\nearnings are more than $217.50 but less than $290 ($7.25 × 40), the amount above $217.50 can be garnished. If disposable earnings are $290\nor more, a maximum of 25% can be garnished. When pay periods cover more than one week, multiples of the weekly restrictions must be\nused to calculate the maximum amounts that may be garnished. The table and examples at the end of this fact sheet illustrate these\namounts.\nMAXIMUM GARNISHMENT OF DISPOSABLE EARNINGS (GENERALLY) BASED ON CURRENT FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF $7.25 PER HOUR\nWeekly Biweekly Semimonthly Monthly\n$217.50 or less: $435.00 or less: $471.25 or less: $942.50 or less:\nNONE NONE NONE NONE\nMore than $217.50 but less More than $435.00 but less More than $471.25 but less than More than $942.50 but less than\nthan $290.00: than $580.00: $628.33: $1256.66:\nAmount ABOVE $217.50 Amount ABOVE $435.00 Amount ABOVE $471.25 Amount ABOVE $942.50\n$290.00 or more: $580.00 or more: $628.33 or more: $1256.66 or more:\nMAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25%\nAs discussed below, these limitations do not apply to certain bankruptcy court orders, or to garnishments to recover debts due for state or\nfederal taxes, and different limitations apply to garnishments pursuant to court orders for child support or alimony.\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings That May be Garnished for Child\nSupport and Alimony\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA also limit the amount of earnings that may be garnished pursuant to court orders for child\nsupport or alimony. The garnishment law allows up to 50% of a worker’s disposable earnings to be garnished for these purposes if the\nworker is supporting another spouse or child, or up to 60% if the worker is not. An additional 5% may be garnished for support payments\nmore than l2 weeks in arrears.\nDefinition of Earnings\nThe CCPA defines earnings as compensation paid or payable for personal services, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and\nperiodic payments from a pension or retirement program. Payments from an employment-based disability plan are also earnings.\nEarnings may include payments received in lump sums, including:\ncommissions;\ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary bonuses;\nproductivity or performance bonuses;\nprofit sharing;\nreferral and sign-on bonuses;\nmoving or relocation incentive payments;\nattendance, safety, and cash service awards;\n\nretroactive merit increases;\npayment for working during a holiday;\nworkers’ compensation payments for wage replacement, whether paid periodically or in a lump sum;\ntermination pay (e.g., payment of last wages, as well as any outstanding accrued benefits);\nseverance pay; and,\nback and front pay payments from insurance settlements.\nIn determining whether certain lump-sum payments are earnings under the CCPA, the central inquiry is whether the employer paid the\namount in question for the employee’s services. If the lump-sum payment is made in exchange for personal services rendered, then like\npayments received periodically, it will be subject to the CCPA’s garnishment limitations. Conversely, lump-sum payments that are unrelated\nto personal services rendered are not earnings under the CCPA. Similarly, payments and reimbursements to employees pursuant to an\nemployer-provided educational assistance program under IRS Code 127 do not constitute earnings for purposes of the CCPA’s limitations on\nwage garnishment.\nFor employees who receive tips, the cash wages paid directly by the employer and the amount of any tip credit claimed by the employer\nunder federal or state law are earnings for the purposes of the wage garnishment law. Tips received in excess of the tip credit amount or in\nexcess of the wages paid directly by the employer (if no tip credit is claimed or allowed) are not earnings for purposes of the CCPA.\nExceptions to Limitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe wage garnishment law specifies that its limitations on the amount of earnings that may be garnished do not apply to certain bankruptcy\ncourt orders, or to debts due for federal or state taxes.\nIf a state wage garnishment law differs from the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, the law resulting in the lower amount of earnings\nbeing garnished must be observed."
