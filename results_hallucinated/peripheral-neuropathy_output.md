#### Task Instructions

**Task Topic:** Understanding peripheral neuropathy

**Task Description:** Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to the peripheral nerves, causing weakness, numbness, and pain, typically in the hands and feet. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about peripheral neuropathy, including its causes, symptoms by nerve type, complications, and prevention strategies.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:** You will need to provide clear and accurate information about peripheral neuropathy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the different types of nerve damage and their symptoms, common causes like diabetes, and complications such as infections and joint damage, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:** Your partner will have gained knowledge about peripheral neuropathy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify which types of nerves (motor, sensory, or autonomic) are affected based on specific symptom patterns. 2. What actions to prioritize for preventing complications in at-risk individuals, particularly those with diabetes. 3. How to respond appropriately when neuropathy-related complications arise, such as foot injuries or exercise safety concerns.
