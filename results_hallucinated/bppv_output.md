- B: Where crystals originate but not where they cause problems
- D: Related to ear anatomy
- E: Related to ear but completely wrong location

---

### Understanding Level Candidates (CQ4-CQ6 targets)

**Candidate U1:**
**Question:** Why does BPPV cause the sensation of spinning specifically when changing head positions?
**Options:**
- A. Head movement creates pressure changes that directly stimulate pain receptors
- B. Dislodged crystals move with gravity, causing abnormal fluid movement that the brain interprets as motion
- C. Position changes temporarily block blood flow to the balance center
- D. The crystals physically press on nerve endings during movement
- E. Inflammation increases when the head is tilted

**Correct:** B
**Bloom's:** Understanding
**Source evidence:** Material explains that dislodged otoconia respond to gravity, causing inappropriate fluid movement in semicircular canals that the brain interprets as head rotation
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Logical but wrong mechanism (not about pressure/pain)
- C: Sounds medically plausible for dizziness
- D: Reasonable mechanical explanation but incorrect
- E: Plausible connection to symptoms

---

**Candidate U2:**
**Question:** What distinguishes BPPV from other causes of dizziness in terms of symptom pattern?
**Options:**
- A. BPPV causes constant, unremitting dizziness throughout the day
- B. BPPV symptoms occur only when standing or walking
- C. BPPV triggers brief episodes with specific head position changes rather than continuous symptoms
- D. BPPV always includes severe headache along with dizziness
- E. BPPV symptoms worsen progressively over weeks

**Correct:** C
**Bloom's:** Understanding
**Source evidence:** Material emphasizes BPPV's characteristic pattern: brief episodes triggered by specific position changes, distinguishing it from continuous vertigo conditions
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Opposite of BPPV pattern (episodic vs constant)
- B: Partially true but misses position-change trigger
- D: Symptom confusion with other conditions
- E: Wrong temporal pattern

---

**Candidate U3:**
**Question:** How does the Dix-Hallpike test help diagnose BPPV?
**Options:**
- A. It measures the electrical activity of the inner ear nerves
- B. It uses imaging to visualize the displaced calcium crystals
- C. It deliberately triggers vertigo and nystagmus by moving the head into positions that would displace crystals
- D. It assesses hearing loss that accompanies BPPV
- E. It measures blood pressure changes during positional changes

**Correct:** C
**Bloom's:** Understanding
**Source evidence:** Material describes Dix-Hallpike as a positioning test that deliberately reproduces symptoms by moving crystals, observing characteristic eye movements (nystagmus)
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Sounds like a legitimate diagnostic test
- B: Logical approach but crystals too small to image
- D: Related to ear but wrong focus
- E: Plausible physiological measurement

---

**Candidate U4:**
**Question:** Why might BPPV recur even after successful treatment?
**Options:**
- A. The original infection was not fully cleared
- B. New calcium crystals can become dislodged over time, especially with head trauma or aging
- C. The semicircular canals become permanently damaged
- D. Medication stopped working after initial treatment
- E. Scar tissue forms and causes new blockages

**Correct:** B
**Bloom's:** Understanding
**Source evidence:** Material notes BPPV can recur because new otoconia can become dislodged, particularly after head injury or with age-related changes
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Misconception that BPPV is infectious
- C: Implies progressive damage (incorrect)
- D: BPPV treatment is usually physical maneuvers, not medication
- E: Plausible anatomical explanation but wrong

---

### Applying Level Candidates (CQ7-CQ9 targets)

**Candidate A1:**
**Question:** Margaret, 68, suddenly experiences intense spinning sensations when she rolls over in bed to turn off her alarm. The room appears to spin for about 30 seconds, then stops. This has happened three mornings this week. Based on BPPV characteristics, what should she do FIRST?
**Options:**
- A. Take an antihistamine medication and avoid moving her head for the rest of the day
- B. Stay in bed with her head elevated on multiple pillows until symptoms completely resolve
- C. Contact her healthcare provider to schedule an evaluation for possible BPPV
- D. Perform vigorous head-shaking exercises to dislodge any crystals
- E. Increase salt intake to improve fluid balance in the inner ear

**Correct:** C
**Bloom's:** Applying
**Source evidence:** Symptoms match BPPV pattern (brief vertigo with position change, rolling in bed). Material emphasizes proper diagnosis before treatment; repositioning maneuvers should be done by trained professionals
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Partial truth (antihistamines sometimes help) but avoiding movement not recommended
- B: Prolonged immobility not treatment approach
- D: Dangerous—proper maneuvers need specific technique
- E: Confusion with Ménière's disease management

---

**Candidate A2:**
**Question:** David was diagnosed with BPPV affecting his right posterior semicircular canal. His doctor performs the Epley maneuver successfully, and symptoms resolve. Two days later, he experiences mild dizziness when looking up at a high shelf. What is the MOST appropriate response?
**Options:**
- A. This indicates treatment failure; he should return immediately for repeat treatment
- B. Mild dizziness can be normal for a few days post-treatment as the inner ear adjusts; he should monitor and avoid sudden movements
- C. He should perform the Epley maneuver on himself at home immediately
- D. This means crystals have moved to the opposite ear; different treatment is needed
- E. He should remain completely still in bed for 48 hours to prevent recurrence

**Correct:** B
**Bloom's:** Applying
**Source evidence:** Material notes some residual dizziness is common after repositioning treatment as the inner ear recalibrates; doesn't require immediate intervention unless severe
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Overreaction to normal post-treatment adjustment
- C: Should consult provider before self-treatment
- D: Plausible concern but jumping to conclusions
- E: Excessive restriction not recommended

---

**Candidate A3:**
**Question:** Susan, 55, has recurrent BPPV that typically affects her left ear. She wakes up with vertigo and recognizes the familiar spinning sensation. She successfully managed a previous episode with the Epley maneuver taught by her physical therapist. What factors should guide her decision about self-treatment versus seeking medical care?
**Options:**
- A. She should always see a doctor first, even with recurrent episodes, because self-treatment is never appropriate
- B. She can attempt the Epley maneuver at home, but should seek care if symptoms don't improve, worsen, or include new symptoms like hearing loss or headache
- C. Self-treatment is fine as long as she does the maneuver at least three times in a row
- D. She should wait at least one week before trying any treatment to see if it resolves on its own
- E. She should only use medication, never repositioning maneuvers, for recurrent episodes

**Correct:** B
**Bloom's:** Applying
**Source evidence:** Material indicates patients can be taught home maneuvers for recurrent BPPV, but should seek care for non-resolving or worsening symptoms or new concerning features
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Too restrictive; home management appropriate for recurrent BPPV with provider guidance
- C: Wrong technique guidance (not about repetitions)
- D: Delays appropriate treatment unnecessarily
- E: Reverses appropriate first-line treatment

---

**Candidate A4:**
**Question:** Robert, 72, experiences brief vertigo when he tilts his head back to look at the sky while gardening. His daughter suggests it might be BPPV. However, Robert also has diabetes and high blood pressure. Which additional symptom would MOST strongly suggest he needs immediate medical evaluation rather than just BPPV assessment?
**Options:**
- A. The vertigo episodes last about 20 seconds each time
- B. He feels unsteady for a few minutes after each vertigo episode
- C. He experiences sudden severe headache, double vision, or difficulty speaking along with the dizziness
- D. The symptoms started after he began a new gardening project
- E. He notices the dizziness is worse in the morning

**Correct:** C
**Bloom's:** Applying
**Source evidence:** Material emphasizes distinguishing BPPV from serious conditions; sudden neurological symptoms (headache, vision changes, speech difficulty) suggest stroke or other emergencies, especially with vascular risk factors
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Consistent with BPPV, not alarming
- B: Normal BPPV pattern
- D: Plausible association but not concerning
- E: Common pattern, not emergency

---

**Candidate A5:**
**Question:** Linda, 60, has had BPPV diagnosed and treated twice before. She's planning a long overseas flight and is concerned about triggering symptoms. Based on BPPV mechanisms and triggers, which strategy would be MOST helpful?
**Options:**
- A. Take prescription sedatives throughout the flight to prevent any movement
- B. Use a neck pillow to minimize head position changes, move slowly when adjusting position, and stay well-hydrated
- C. Perform the Epley maneuver immediately before boarding the plane
- D. Recline the seat fully and remain completely motionless for the entire flight
- E. Request a special medical clearance form from the airline

**Correct:** B
**Bloom's:** Applying
**Source evidence:** Material emphasizes BPPV is triggered by head position changes; supporting head/neck and moving slowly are practical strategies. Dehydration can worsen symptoms.
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Excessive sedation not recommended and doesn't prevent BPPV
- C: Inappropriate timing (not currently symptomatic)
- D: Impractical and complete immobility not necessary
- E: BPPV doesn't require special airline clearance

| **Task topic** | Understanding BPPV symptoms, causes, and management |
| **Task description** | Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common inner ear disorder that causes brief episodes of dizziness triggered by specific head movements. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about BPPV, including what causes the condition, how to recognize its characteristic symptoms, and when to seek medical evaluation versus attempting self-management. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about BPPV to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the underlying mechanism involving calcium crystals in the inner ear, characteristic symptoms and triggers, and appropriate responses to initial or recurrent symptoms, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about BPPV, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to recognize BPPV symptoms and distinguish them from more serious conditions that require immediate medical attention. 2. When self-management with positioning maneuvers is appropriate versus when professional medical evaluation is necessary. 3. What factors influence recurrence and how to handle recurrent episodes safely. |
