| **Task topic** | Filing housing discrimination complaints |
| **Task description** | Housing discrimination remains a significant issue affecting people's ability to secure safe and fair housing. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about housing discrimination complaints, including what constitutes illegal discrimination, the protected classes under fair housing laws, and the procedures for filing a complaint with the appropriate enforcement agencies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about housing discrimination complaints to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of protected classes under fair housing laws, which housing-related actions constitute illegal discrimination, and the proper procedures and timelines for filing complaints, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about housing discrimination complaints, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific housing situations constitute illegal discrimination based on protected class status and the type of housing provider involved. 2. Identifying the correct enforcement agency to contact based on the nature and timing of the discrimination. 3. Evaluating the appropriate course of action when facing multiple barriers or complex discrimination scenarios involving different protected classes. |
