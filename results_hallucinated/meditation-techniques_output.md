I'll execute the Automatic Question Generation workflow for meditation techniques. Since reference material is provided, I'll follow Path B (starting with Question Writer).

Let me begin by analyzing the reference material and generating the comprehension quiz.

- ⚠️ Distractors C and D are too obviously wrong

**Rejected R3** - Score: 6.8/10
- ⚠️ Relatively straightforward if you know the definition
- ⚠️ Distractor strength moderate - some obviously wrong

- ⚠️ Option B too obviously dangerous/wrong
- Needs revision for balance

**Rejected U5** - Score: 7.2/10
- ✅ Passes criteria but less discriminating than U2
- Selected U2 instead because it tests more fundamental distinction

**Rejected A4** - Score: 7.0/10

- Selected A1 instead as it tests more critical principle (open attitude)
- Both address adaptation but A1 has stronger discrimination

**Rejected A5** - Score: 7.1/10
- ✅ Borderline acceptable
- Selected A3 instead for clearer application scenario
- A5 requires more inference about "informal practice"
