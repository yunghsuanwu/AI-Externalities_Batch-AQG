## Step 2: Question Writing

I'll generate 15+ candidate questions (5 per Bloom's level) targeting challenging, discriminating content.

### Remembering Level Candidates (CQ1-CQ3)

**Candidate R1:**
**Question:** What is the primary physical mechanism that autogenic training uses to promote relaxation?
- A. Rapid breathing patterns to increase oxygen flow
- B. Visual imagery of peaceful scenes
- C. Repeating words or suggestions to create sensations of warmth and heaviness ✓
- D. Systematic tensing and releasing of muscle groups
- E. External monitoring of physiological responses through electronic devices

**Source evidence:** Material states autogenic training involves "repeating words or suggestions in your mind" to create "feelings such as warmth and heaviness in your body"

**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Plausible confusion with deep breathing techniques
- B: Confusion with guided imagery
- D: Confusion with progressive relaxation
- E: Confusion with biofeedback

---

**Candidate R2:**
**Question:** According to NIH guidelines, which situation requires you to postpone relaxation techniques and consult a healthcare provider FIRST?

**Source evidence:** Material defines biofeedback as using "electronic devices to help you learn to control certain body functions"

**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Plausible but not the defining characteristic
- C: Confusion with deep breathing
- D: Not stated as requirement
- E: Confusion with autogenic training

---

- C. Tense, release, visualize, relax
- D. Visualize, tense, hold, release
- E. Hold, tense, relax, breathe

**Source evidence:** Material describes "tensing and relaxing each major muscle group"

**Distractor rationale:**
- A, C, D, E: Plausible but incorrect sequences mixing elements

---

**Candidate R5:**
**Question:** What specific body response does deep breathing directly aim to slow down?
- A. Metabolic rate
- B. Heart rate ✓
- C. Digestion
- D. Brain wave activity
- E. Muscle tension

**Source evidence:** Material states deep breathing "slows your heart rate"

- D: Oversimplifies the material's nuanced position
- E: Overstates and contradicts complementary approach concept

---

**Candidate U2:**
**Question:** How does guided imagery differ fundamentally from deep breathing exercises?

- D: Speed not compared in material
- E: Reversed - both can be self-taught

---

**Candidate U3:**
**Question:** What is the relationship between autogenic training and biofeedback as described in the material?
