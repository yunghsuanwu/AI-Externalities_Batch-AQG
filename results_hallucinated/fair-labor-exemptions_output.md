**Reference Material Scope Assessment:**

The Department of Labor Fact Sheet #17A covers:
- **Core Topic:** Exemptions from FLSA minimum wage and overtime requirements
- **Specific Coverage:**
  - Executive exemption criteria (salary basis, primary duty, supervision)
  - Administrative exemption criteria (office work, discretion/judgment)
  - Professional exemption criteria (learned/creative professions)

**Length Assessment:**
- Estimated: 2,500-3,000 words

| **Task topic** | FLSA white-collar overtime exemptions |
| **Task description** | The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most employees, but provides exemptions for certain "white-collar" positions that meet specific salary and duties tests. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about FLSA exemptions, including salary thresholds, job duties criteria for different exemption categories, and how salary basis requirements protect exempt status. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Fair Labor Standards Act exemptions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of salary thresholds for different exemptions, the tests for executive and administrative exemptions, and how salary deductions affect exempt status, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Fair Labor Standards Act exemptions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific salary amounts and payment structures meet exemption requirements. 2. Calculating whether supervision of part-time employees satisfies the full-time equivalent standard for executive exemption. 3. Analyzing workplace scenarios involving salary deductions, job duties, and multiple exemption criteria to determine proper classification. |

| **Question** | Participants | Aisha is a department head earning $900 per week. She supervises three full-time employees and has authority to hire and fire.

What is the MOST likely consequence of this deduction? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. No consequence because the deduction was for a partial day absence", "B. No consequence because she still earned more than $684 that week", "C. The deduction could destroy her exempt status because salary cannot be reduced for partial day absences", "D. She must be immediately reclassified as hourly for all future pay periods", "E. The employer must pay her overtime for all previous weeks worked"] |

Does Taylor meet the supervision requirement for the executive exemption? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. No, because she does not have final authority to hire or fire", "B. No, because she only supervises one full-time employee", "C. Yes, because two part-time employees equal one full-time equivalent, giving her supervision of two full-time equivalents", "D. Yes, because she has three direct reports regardless of their hours", "E. No, because team leaders cannot qualify for executive exemption"] |
