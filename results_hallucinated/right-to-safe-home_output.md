## Stage 3: Curriculum Designer

### Comprehension Quiz Analysis

Analyzing finalized CQ1-CQ9 to derive learning objectives and familiarity quiz...

**Key Knowledge Areas from CQs:**
1. **Specific legal thresholds** (repair and deduct limits, notice periods, frequency)
2. **Legal concepts** (habitability principle, retaliation protection)
3. **Distinctions** (habitability vs. cosmetic, remedies)
4. **Application** (choosing appropriate remedy, identifying violations)

### Learning Objectives Derivation

**LO1 (from CQ1-CQ3 - Remembering):**
"Identify specific legal requirements and limits for tenant remedies under California habitability law, including the repair and deduct remedy limits ($1,000 or one month's rent, whichever is less), required notice periods (30 days), and frequency restrictions (twice per year)."
- Maps to: CQ1, CQ2, CQ3

**LO2 (from CQ4-CQ6 - Understanding):**
"Explain the legal principles underlying California's habitability protections, including why rent payment entitles tenants to habitable conditions, how habitability issues differ from cosmetic concerns, and the distinctions between different tenant remedies."
- Maps to: CQ4, CQ5, CQ6

**LO3 (from CQ7-CQ9 - Applying):**
"Apply California habitability law to realistic tenant scenarios by selecting appropriate legal remedies based on specific circumstances, identifying which maintenance issues qualify as habitability violations, and recognizing when retaliation protections apply."
- Maps to: CQ7, CQ8, CQ9

### Task Instructions

**Task Description (~50 words):**
"California law requires landlords to maintain rental units in habitable condition, but many tenants don't know their specific legal rights and remedies. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about tenants' right to safe and well-maintained housing under California law, including habitability requirements, legal remedies like repair and deduct, notice requirements, and protections against retaliation."

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
"You will need to provide clear and accurate information about tenants' rights to habitable housing to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of repair and deduct procedures and limits, how to distinguish habitability violations from cosmetic issues, and protections against landlord retaliation, so pay attention to these details."

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
"Your partner will have gained knowledge about tenants' rights to habitable housing, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to properly use the repair and deduct remedy, including calculating deduction limits when repair costs and monthly rent vary, and understanding the timing and notice requirements. 2. How to identify which maintenance problems qualify as habitability violations versus cosmetic issues that landlords are not legally required to fix. 3. How to recognize and respond to landlord retaliation after exercising tenant rights, including knowing what legal protections exist."

### Familiarity Quiz (FQ1-FQ4)

**FQ1 (Domain - Remembering):**
"How familiar are you with common civics and housing terms such as lease agreements, tenant rights, and landlord responsibilities?"

**FQ2 (Domain - Understanding):**
"How well do you understand how housing laws protect tenants and establish responsibilities for both tenants and landlords?"

**FQ3 (Task - Remembering):**
"How familiar are you with terms related to housing habitability such as repair and deduct, habitability violations, and retaliation protections?"

**FQ4 (Task - Understanding):**
"How well do you understand the concepts behind California's habitability laws, such as what conditions landlords must maintain and what legal remedies tenants can pursue?"
