## STEP 1: REFERENCE MATERIAL ANALYSIS

Let me examine the provided PDF to understand the scope and content...

**ERROR DETECTED:** I cannot access the local file path `/Users/WuYung-Hsuan/Desktop/coding-stuff/AI-Externalities_Batch-AQG/reference_materials/rent-increases.pdf`

**ENTERING HUMAN CLARIFICATION MODE**

## ⚠️ CLARIFICATION NEEDED

I see you've indicated reference material should be provided at:
`/Users/WuYung-Hsuan/Desktop/coding-stuff/AI-Externalities_Batch-AQG/reference_materials/rent-increases.pdf`

However, I cannot access local file paths from your computer. Could you please:

1. **Attach the PDF file directly** to this conversation, OR
2. **Provide a publicly accessible URL** where I can fetch the document, OR
3. **Confirm you'd like me to proceed with Path A** (source discovery) instead, where I'll search for authoritative sources about California rent increase laws

**Note:** Based on your metadata, the intended source is the State of California DOJ guide: https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/Know-Your-Rights-Tenants-English.pdf

Would you like me to:
- **Option A:** Fetch and use the DOJ guide from that URL?
- **Option B:** Wait for you to attach the PDF?
- **Option C:** Proceed with independent source discovery?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll continue with the appropriate workflow path.
