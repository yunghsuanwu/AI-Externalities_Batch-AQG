| **Task title** | Secured and unsecured credit |
| **Task topic** | Understanding secured versus unsecured credit |
| **Task description** | Credit products come in two main forms: secured and unsecured. Understanding the differences between these types of credit, including how they work, their requirements, and their impact on your finances, is essential for making informed borrowing decisions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about secured and unsecured credit, including their definitions, collateral requirements, and implications for credit building. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about secured and unsecured credit to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between secured and unsecured credit cards, how collateral affects credit products, and the role of security deposits in building credit, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about secured and unsecured credit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which type of credit card is appropriate for someone with poor or no credit history versus someone with established credit. 2. Understanding what happens to collateral when payments are missed on secured versus unsecured accounts. 3. Evaluating the financial implications of choosing secured versus unsecured credit products in different scenarios. |

| **Question** | Participants | Elena is comparing two credit card offers: a secured card requiring a $300 deposit with a 24.99% APR and no annual fee, versus an unsecured card with a 28.99% APR and a $75 annual fee. She has fair credit (credit score 630) and plans to carry a small balance of about $200 monthly. Assuming both report to credit bureaus, which option makes the MOST financial sense? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. The unsecured card, because she avoids tying up $300 in a deposit despite higher costs", "B. The secured card, because the lower APR saves money on interest and she'll get the deposit back later", "C. The unsecured card, because it will improve her credit faster without requiring collateral", "D. The secured card, because the annual fee on the unsecured card makes it more expensive overall", "E. Neither option, because she should focus on paying cash until her credit score reaches 700"] |
