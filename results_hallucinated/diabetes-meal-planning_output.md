*Maps to: CQ1, CQ2, CQ3*

**LO2 (Understanding):** Explain why consistent carbohydrate distribution throughout the day helps manage blood sugar levels, how to convert nutrition label information into carbohydrate servings, and the rationale behind the plate method for diabetes meal planning.
*Maps to: CQ4, CQ5, CQ6*

**LO3 (Applying):** Apply carbohydrate counting principles to calculate total carbohydrate servings in multi-portion meals, select appropriate food combinations to meet carbohydrate targets, and make meal choices that align with diabetes meal planning guidelines in real-world situations.
*Maps to: CQ7, CQ8, CQ9*

### Task Instructions

**Task description (~50 words):**
Diabetes requires careful meal planning to manage blood sugar levels effectively. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about diabetes meal planning, including carbohydrate counting, portion control using the plate method, and selecting appropriate food combinations to meet nutritional goals while maintaining stable blood sugar.

**Task instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about diabetes meal planning to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how to count carbohydrates in different foods, how to use the plate method for balanced meals, and why consistent carbohydrate intake matters for blood sugar control, so pay attention to these details.

**Task instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about diabetes meal planning, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to calculate total carbohydrate servings when eating multiple portions or combining different foods in a meal. 2. How to select appropriate meal combinations that meet specific carbohydrate targets while following the plate method. 3. How to make food choices in real-world situations like restaurants that align with diabetes meal planning guidelines and blood sugar management goals.

### Familiarity Quiz (FQ1-FQ4)

**FQ1 (Domain-specific, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with common health and nutrition terms such as blood sugar (glucose), carbohydrates, and portion sizes?

**FQ2 (Domain-specific, Understanding):**
How well do you understand the relationship between food intake and health outcomes, such as how different nutrients affect the body or how eating patterns influence chronic disease management?

**FQ3 (Task-specific, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with diabetes meal planning terms and concepts such as carbohydrate servings, the plate method, and carbohydrate counting?

**FQ4 (Task-specific, Understanding):**
How well do you understand how carbohydrate intake affects blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and why consistent meal timing and portion control are important for diabetes management?
