| **Task title** | Coeliac disease and gluten-free diet |
| **Task topic** | Managing coeliac disease through diet |
| **Task description** | Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, causing damage to the small intestine. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet, including which foods are safe and unsafe, how to prevent cross-contamination, and how to maintain proper nutrition while avoiding gluten. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which grains and foods contain gluten, cross-contamination risks in food preparation, and nutritional considerations for maintaining a balanced gluten-free diet, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to distinguish between safe and unsafe foods based on ingredients and labeling, particularly understanding the difference between "wheat-free" and "gluten-free" claims. 2. How to prevent cross-contamination when preparing meals for someone with coeliac disease in a shared kitchen environment. 3. How to plan nutritionally balanced gluten-free meals that address potential nutrient gaps while incorporating naturally gluten-free whole foods. |
