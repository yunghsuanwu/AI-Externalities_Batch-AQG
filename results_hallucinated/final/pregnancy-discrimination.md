| **Task ID** | pregnancy-discrimination |
| **Task title** | Pregnancy discrimination |
| **Task topic** | Pregnancy discrimination protections |
| **Task description** | The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) protects pregnant workers from discrimination and requires reasonable workplace accommodations. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about pregnancy discrimination protections, including employer obligations, accommodation requirements, harassment standards, and the interaction between different federal laws. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about pregnancy discrimination protections to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which employers are covered, what types of accommodations are required, and how harassment is defined under the law, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about pregnancy discrimination protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether an employer is required to provide accommodations in specific workplace scenarios, considering factors like company size and existing policies. 2. How to identify when pregnancy-related comments or behaviors cross the line into unlawful harassment. 3. How different federal laws (PDA, ADA, PUMP Act) interact to protect pregnant and postpartum workers in various situations. |
