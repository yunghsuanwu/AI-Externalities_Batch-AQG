| **Task ID** | eviction-process |
| **Task title** | Eviction process |
| **Task topic** | California eviction process |
| **Task description** | The eviction process in California involves specific legal requirements that protect both landlords and tenants. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about California's eviction process, including notice requirements, legal procedures, timeline rules, and protections against illegal evictions. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about California's eviction process to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of required notice periods for different situations, the difference between various types of eviction notices, and what constitutes illegal eviction practices, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about California's eviction process, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine which type of notice is required based on the tenancy length and reason for eviction. 2. How to calculate proper notice periods and response deadlines when specific dates are involved. 3. How to identify illegal "self-help" eviction actions and understand what legal procedures landlords must follow instead. |
