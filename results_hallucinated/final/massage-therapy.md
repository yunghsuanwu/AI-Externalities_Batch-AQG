| **Task title** | Massage therapy |
| **Task topic** | Massage therapy benefits and safety |
| **Task description** | Massage therapy is a widely used complementary health approach involving the manipulation of soft tissues in the body. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about massage therapy, including the types of massage, research evidence on its effectiveness for specific conditions, and important safety considerations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about massage therapy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the effectiveness of massage for different health conditions, safety considerations for specific populations, and what to expect during massage therapy sessions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about massage therapy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether massage therapy is appropriate and safe for specific health conditions and populations (such as pregnant women, people with injuries, or those with certain medical conditions). 2. Evaluating the research evidence for massage therapy's effectiveness in treating particular symptoms or conditions. 3. Making informed decisions about seeking massage therapy, including understanding what qualifications to look for in practitioners and what to communicate about your health history. |
