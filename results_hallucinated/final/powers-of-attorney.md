| **Task topic** | Understanding powers of attorney in Texas |
| **Task description** | A power of attorney is a legal document that allows you to designate someone to make decisions on your behalf when you cannot. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about powers of attorney, including the different types, when they become effective, what powers can be granted, and how they can be terminated. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about powers of attorney to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between durable and non-durable powers of attorney, when powers of attorney become effective or terminate, and what specific powers can be granted to an agent, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about powers of attorney, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which type of power of attorney is appropriate for different situations, such as planning for future incapacity versus handling immediate needs. 2. Understanding what actions an agent can and cannot take under different types of powers of attorney, including restrictions on gifts and changes to beneficiary designations. 3. Identifying when a power of attorney automatically terminates and what steps are needed to revoke one before that point. |
