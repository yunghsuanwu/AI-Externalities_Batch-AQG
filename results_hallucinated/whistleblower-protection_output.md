**Task Instructions:**

**Task Description:**
Whistleblowers who report violations of workplace safety, environmental, and corporate fraud laws are protected under federal statutes, but strict deadlines and specific procedures apply. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about whistleblower protection under OSHA-enforced statutes, including filing deadlines, what constitutes protected activity, and how to respond to retaliation.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about whistleblower protection to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of filing deadlines for different statutes, what types of activities are protected, and what constitutes retaliation, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about whistleblower protection, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to calculate filing deadlines when retaliation occurs under different federal whistleblower statutes. 2. How to determine whether internal or external reporting qualifies as protected activity. 3. How to identify and document patterns of retaliation when adverse actions occur over time.
