| **Task title** | Carpal tunnel syndrome |
| **Task topic** | Understanding carpal tunnel syndrome |
| **Task description** | Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that causes numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand and arm due to pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about carpal tunnel syndrome, including its symptoms, risk factors, and treatment approaches. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about carpal tunnel syndrome to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the characteristic symptoms and when they typically occur, which activities or conditions increase risk for developing the condition, and available treatment options from conservative measures to surgical intervention, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about carpal tunnel syndrome, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Recognizing the specific pattern of symptoms that distinguish carpal tunnel syndrome from other hand conditions, including which fingers are affected and when symptoms worsen. 2. Identifying personal risk factors and activities that may contribute to developing the condition, and understanding which occupational or health factors increase vulnerability. 3. Determining appropriate treatment approaches based on symptom severity and duration, including when conservative measures are sufficient versus when medical intervention may be necessary. |
