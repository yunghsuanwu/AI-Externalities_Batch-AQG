| **Task title** | Thoracic outlet syndrome |
| **Task topic** | Thoracic outlet syndrome diagnosis and symptoms |
| **Task description** | Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition where blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and first rib become compressed. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about thoracic outlet syndrome, including its different types, characteristic symptoms, risk factors, and when to seek medical evaluation. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about thoracic outlet syndrome to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the three types of TOS and their distinct symptoms, activities or conditions that increase risk for developing TOS, and warning signs that require immediate medical attention, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about thoracic outlet syndrome, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between the three types of thoracic outlet syndrome based on which structures are compressed and their resulting symptoms. 2. Identifying when numbness and tingling symptoms might indicate TOS versus other conditions, considering the specific distribution pattern described in TOS. 3. Determining which symptoms require immediate medical evaluation versus those that can be monitored, particularly regarding vascular symptoms and their potential complications. |

| **Question** | Participants | Why does neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome specifically cause symptoms in the ring and little fingers rather than other fingers? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. These fingers are farthest from the heart and receive less blood flow", "B. The compressed brachial plexus nerves supply sensation to these specific fingers", "C. These fingers have the smallest blood vessels that compress most easily", "D. Muscle fatigue affects these fingers first during overhead activities", "E. The cervical rib most commonly presses against nerves serving these fingers"] |

Neurogenic TOS affects large vessels causing swelling, while vascular types affect small nerves causing pain", "C. Neurogenic TOS compresses arteries causing coldness, while vascular types compress nerves causing weakness", "D. Neurogenic TOS affects the shoulder joint causing stiffness, while vascular types affect the ribcage causing breathing difficulty", "E. Neurogenic TOS compresses veins causing discoloration, while vascular types compress tendons causing movement restrictions"] |

| **Question** | Participants | Maria, age 42, experiences occasional numbness in her ring and little fingers when reaching overhead to put away dishes, which resolves when she lowers her arm. She has no pain, swelling, or color changes. Her sister was recently diagnosed with arterial TOS. Based on Maria's symptoms and TOS characteristics, what is the BEST course of action? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Seek emergency care immediately because numbness always indicates serious vascular compromise", "B. Schedule a routine medical appointment to evaluate for possible neurogenic TOS, as her symptoms are characteristic but not urgent", "C. Assume she has arterial TOS like her sister and request the same treatment", "D. Ignore the symptoms since they resolve on their own and family history doesn't affect TOS risk", "E. Begin taking blood thinners preventatively since TOS runs in families"] |
