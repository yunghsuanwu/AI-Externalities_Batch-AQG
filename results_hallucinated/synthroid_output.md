| **Task ID** | synthroid |
| **Task title** | Synthroid |
| **Task topic** | Synthroid medication for hypothyroidism |
| **Task description** | Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium) is a prescription medication used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Synthroid, including its proper administration, interactions with food and other medications, and important warnings about its effects. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Synthroid to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how to take Synthroid properly, what foods and medications interfere with its absorption, and what symptoms might indicate serious side effects, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Synthroid, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining the correct timing and method for taking Synthroid to ensure proper absorption. 2. Identifying which foods, supplements, or medications should be avoided or timed differently when taking Synthroid. 3. Recognizing when side effects or symptoms require immediate medical attention versus normal adjustment periods. |
