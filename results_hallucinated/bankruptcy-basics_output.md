# Bankruptcy basics workflow execution

I'll execute the Automatic Question Generation workflow for bankruptcy basics. Since reference material is provided, this follows **Path B** (starting with Question Writer).

## Step 1: Analyzing Reference Material

## Step 3: Psychometric Reviewer - Evaluating Questions

Now I'll evaluate all 15 candidates against MCQ best practices and difficulty standards.

### MCQ Best Practices Scoring

**Remembering Questions:**

| Question | Score | Key Issues | Decision |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| R1 | 8.5/10 | Strong - specific threshold, all options plausible | **SELECT** |
| R2 | 8.0/10 | Strong - common misconception about timeframe | **SELECT** |
| R3 | 8.2/10 | Strong - tests exception knowledge | **SELECT** |
| R4 | 7.8/10 | Good but slightly less discriminating | Backup |
| R5 | 7.5/10 | Good but timeframe is somewhat general knowledge | Backup |

**Understanding Questions:**

| Question | Score | Key Issues | Decision |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| U1 | 8.5/10 | Strong - tests core conceptual difference | **SELECT** |
| U2 | 8.0/10 | Good - explains WHY of exception | **SELECT** |
| U3 | 8.3/10 | Strong - tests mechanism understanding | **SELECT** |
| U4 | 7.9/10 | Good - tests purpose of requirement | Backup |
| U5 | 7.7/10 | Good but could be stronger | Backup |

**Applying Questions:**

| Question | Score | Key Issues | Decision |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| A1 | 9.0/10 | Excellent - complex scenario with multiple factors | **SELECT** |
| A2 | 8.5/10 | Strong - requires calculating exemption impact | **SELECT** |
| A3 | 8.8/10 | Strong - tests strategy selection with constraints | **SELECT** |

### Final Selection (9 Questions)

**Correct Answer Distribution:**
- Position A: 0
- Position B: 4 (CQ1, CQ2, CQ5, CQ6)
- Position C: 4 (CQ3, CQ4, CQ7, CQ8)
- Position D: 1 (CQ9)
- Position E: 0

**Adjustment needed:** Redistribute to avoid concentration in B/C positions.

## Step 4: Curriculum Designer - Deriving Learning Objectives

Based on the finalized comprehension questions, I'll derive learning objectives and create the familiarity quiz.

### Learning Objectives

**LO1:** Recall key numerical thresholds in Minnesota bankruptcy law, including homestead exemptions ($390,000), vehicle exemptions ($4,600), and credit reporting duration (10 years for Chapter 7).
*Maps to: CQ1, CQ2*

**LO2:** Identify which types of debts are dischargeable versus non-dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings.
*Maps to: CQ3*

**LO3:** Explain the fundamental differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, including liquidation vs. repayment structures and the purpose of the automatic stay.
*Maps to: CQ4, CQ5, CQ6*

**LO4:** Apply bankruptcy exemption rules to determine which assets a debtor can keep and what happens to non-exempt property.
*Maps to: CQ7, CQ8*

**LO5:** Evaluate which bankruptcy chapter is most appropriate for specific financial situations involving multiple debt types, income constraints, and asset protection needs.
*Maps to: CQ9*

### Familiarity Quiz (FQ1-FQ4)

**FQ1 (Domain, Remembering):** "How familiar are you with common legal terms and concepts such as debtor, creditor, and legal procedures?"

**FQ2 (Domain, Understanding):** "How well do you understand how the legal system works to resolve disputes and protect individual rights?"

| **Task topic** | Personal bankruptcy procedures and consequences |
| **Task description** | Personal bankruptcy is a legal process that helps individuals eliminate or repay debts under court protection. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about bankruptcy basics, including the differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which debts can be eliminated, what property you can keep through exemptions, and how bankruptcy affects your credit and financial future. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about bankruptcy basics to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which types of debts can and cannot be eliminated, and what property exemptions protect in Minnesota, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about bankruptcy basics, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine what assets you can keep when filing bankruptcy based on Minnesota exemption rules, including calculating whether equity in homes or vehicles exceeds protected amounts. 2. How to decide whether Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy is more appropriate given specific financial circumstances such as income level, debt types, and goals like stopping foreclosure. 3. How to understand which of your debts will actually be eliminated in bankruptcy versus which ones you'll still have to pay after the bankruptcy is complete. |
