In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Synthroid, including how to take it correctly, foods and supplements that affect absorption, and important safety considerations. |\n| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Synthroid to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of timing requirements for taking the medication, foods and supplements that interfere with absorption, and safety warnings, so pay attention to these details. |\n| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Synthroid, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to schedule Synthroid with other supplements like calcium or iron. 2. How to interpret common side effects and know when they are expected versus concerning. 3. How to prepare for blood tests that measure thyroid function. |\n| **Formulas** | NA |\n\n\n## Familiarity Quiz\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | FQ1 |\n| **Question** | Participants | How familiar are you with common terms used in drug labels such as \"indication,\" \"contraindication,\" \"dosage administration,\" and \"adverse reaction\"? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"1 (Not at all familiar)\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7 (Very familiar)\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Category** | Researcher-only | Domain-specific |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Remembering |\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | FQ2 |\n| **Question** | Participants | How well do you understand how medications work in the body, including concepts such as dosing schedules, drug storage requirements, and side effect management? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"1 (Not at all)\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7 (Very well)\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Category** | Researcher-only | Domain-specific |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Understanding |\n\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | FQ3 |\n| **Question** | Participants | How familiar are you with terms related to thyroid medication such as hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, and TSH levels? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"1 (Not at all familiar)\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7 (Very familiar)\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Category** | Researcher-only | Task-specific |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Remembering |\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | FQ4 |\n| **Question** | Participants | How well do you understand how thyroid replacement medications work and why specific administration guidelines must be followed? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"1 (Not at all)\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7 (Very well)\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Category** | Researcher-only | Task-specific |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Understanding |\n\n## Comprehension Quiz\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | CQ1 |\n| **Question** | Participants | How long should patients wait after taking Synthroid before eating or drinking anything other than water? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"A. 10-15 minutes\", \"B. 15-20 minutes\", \"C. 30-60 minutes\", \"D. 2-3 hours\", \"E. 4 hours\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Correct answers** | Researcher-only | [\"C. 30-60 minutes\"] |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Remembering |\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | CQ2 |\n| **Question** | Participants | According to Synthroid guidelines, how far apart should Synthroid be taken from iron supplements? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"A. 30 minutes\", \"B. 1 hour\", \"C. 2 hours\", \"D. 4 hours\", \"E. 6 hours\"] |\n| **Answer type** | Researcher-only | Single-select |\n| **Correct answers** | Researcher-only | [\"D. 4 hours\"] |\n| **Bloom's level** | Researcher-only | Remembering |\n\n| Field | Visibility | Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Question ID** | Participants | CQ3 |\n| **Question** | Participants | Which of the following foods can make Synthroid LESS effective by reducing absorption? |\n| **Options** | Participants | [\"A.
