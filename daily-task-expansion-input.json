      "reference_material_content": "What is Truvada?\nTruvada is a prescription medicine approved by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) for the following uses:\nTo treat HIV in adults and children who weigh at least 37 lb (17\nkg). Truvada for HIV treatment is always used in combination\nwith other HIV medicines.\nFor HIV PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV in adults and adolescents\nwho weigh at least 77 lb (35 kg), are HIV negative, and are at risk\nof getting HIV from sex. Truvada for PrEP should always be\nused in combination with safer sex practices, such as using\ncondoms, to reduce the risk of getting other sexually\ntransmitted infections.\nTruvada contains two different medicines: emtricitabine and\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate.\n\nFor more information on the use of Truvada in people with HIV,\nplease refer to the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in\nAdults and Adolescents With HIV and the Guidelines for the Use of\nAntiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection.\nFor more information about HIV PrEP, including information on\nwho should consider using PrEP, please read the HIVinfo fact sheet\non PrEP.\nHIV medicines cannot cure HIV/AIDS, but using HIV medicines as\ndirected by your health care provider helps people with HIV live\nlonger, healthier lives. When used as treatment, HIV medicines also\nreduce the risk of HIV transmission. Whether you are taking Truvada\nfor HIV prevention or for HIV treatment (in combination with other\nHIV medicines), do not cut down on, skip, or stop taking your HIV\nmedicine(s) unless your health care provider tells you to.\nTruvada is also effective against hepatitis B virus infection (HBV)\nand may be included as part of an antiretroviral therapy (ART)\nregimen to treat both HIV and HBV in people with HIV/HBV\ncoinfection. For more information on the HBV-related use of\nTruvada, please refer to the HBV section of the Guidelines for the\nPrevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and\nAdolescents With HIV.\n\nWhat should I tell my health\ncare provider before taking\nTruvada?\nBefore taking Truvada, tell your health care provider:\nIf you are allergic to either of the HIV medicines in Truvada\n(emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) or any other\nmedicines.\nIf you have liver problems, including hepatitis B virus infection\n(HBV).\nIf you have kidney problems or receive kidney dialysis\ntreatment.\nIf you have bone problems.\nIf you have any other medical conditions.\nIf you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Talk to your\nhealth care provider about the risks and benefits of taking\nTruvada during pregnancy. For more information on the use of\nTruvada during pregnancy, please refer to the following\nsections of the Perinatal HIV Clinical Guidelines: Table 14.\nAntiretroviral Drug Use in Pregnant People with HIV and Pre-\nexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Prevent HIV During\nPericonception, Antepartum, and Postpartum Periods.\n\nIf you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. For mothers with\nHIV in the United States, the Guideline recommends speaking\nwith your health care provider to discuss options for feeding\nyour baby. Mothers with suppressed viral load have a less than\n1% chance of transmitting HIV to their baby via their own milk.\nAlthough most medicines are safe to use while breastfeeding,\nsome medicines should be avoided. Always let your health care\nprovider know about all the medicines and supplements you\nare using before you start breastfeeding.\nIf you are using hormone-based birth control (such as pills,\nimplants, or vaginal rings). For more information about using\nbirth control and HIV medicines at the same time, view the\nHIVinfo HIV and Birth Control infographic.\nAbout other prescription and nonprescription medicines,\nvitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you\nare taking or plan to take. Truvada may affect the way other\nmedicines or products work, and other medicines or products\nmay affect how Truvada works. Taking Truvada together with\ncertain medicines or products may cause serious side\neffects.\nBefore taking Truvada for HIV PrEP, you must get tested to be\nsure you are HIV negative. Do not take Truvada for HIV PrEP\nunless you are confirmed to be HIV negative.\nBefore taking Truvada for PrEP, also tell your health care provider:\nIf you had a flu-like illness anytime in the month before starting\nTruvada or if you have a flu-like illness at any time while taking\n\nTruvada. Flu-like symptoms may be a sign that you could have\nrecently gotten HIV. The flu-like symptoms of a new HIV\ninfection may include: tiredness, fever, nighttime sweating,\nrash, vomiting, diarrhea, joint or muscle aches, headache, sore\nthroat, or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin.\nIf you think that you were exposed to HIV. Your health care\nprovider may want to do more tests to be sure you are still HIV\nnegative.\nWhile taking Truvada for PrEP, you will get tested for HIV at least\nevery 3 months or when your healthcare provider tells you.\nHow should I take Truvada?\nTruvada comes in tablet form in the following strengths:\n100 mg emtricitabine and 150 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n133 mg emtricitabine and 200 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n167 mg emtricitabine and 250 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n200 mg emtricitabine and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\nTake Truvada according to your health care providerʼs\ninstructions. Do not miss a dose of Truvada, and do not change your\ndose or stop taking Truvada without first talking with your health\ncare provider.\nTake Truvada with or without food at the same time each day.\n\nTell your healthcare provider if you or your child cannot swallow\nTruvada tablets.\nIf you take Truvada to treat HIV, always take it in combination with\nother HIV medicines.\nIf you take Truvada for PrEP, it is important that you take it\nevery day as scheduled to help reduce the risk of getting HIV.\nAlways use PrEP in combination with condoms and other safer sex\npractices.\nIf you have taken too much Truvada, contact your health care\nprovider or local poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or online)\nright away, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.\nFor more information on how to take Truvada, see the FDA drug\nlabel.\nWhat should I do if I forget a\ndose?\nIf you miss a dose of Truvada, take the missed dose as soon as you\nremember it. But if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the\nmissed dose and just take your next dose at the regular time. Do not\ntake two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose.\n\nWhat side effects can\nTruvada cause?\nTruvada may cause side effects. Some side effects of Truvada can\nbe serious as noted above. Many side effects from HIV medicines,\nsuch as nausea or occasional dizziness, are manageable. See the\nHIVinfo fact sheet on HIV Medicines and Side Effects for more\ninformation.\nOther possible side effects of Truvada include:\nChanges in your immune system (called immune reconstitution\ninflammatory syndrome or IRIS). IRIS is a condition that\nsometimes occurs when the immune system begins to recover\nafter treatment with an HIV medicine. As the immune system\ngets stronger, it may have an increased response to a previously\nhidden infection.\nBone problems, including bone pain, or softening or thinning of\nthe bones (osteopenia), which may lead to fractures.\nTell your health care provider if you have any side effect that\nbothers you or that does not go away.\nThese are not all the possible side effects of Truvada. To learn more\nabout possible side effects of Truvada, read the drug label or\npackage insert or talk to your health care provider or pharmacist.\nYou can report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 (1-800-332-\n1088) or online."

      "reference_material_content": "Patient Information\nNeulasta® (nu-las-tah)\n(pegfilgrastim)\ninjection\nSingle-Dose Prefilled Syringe and Single-Dose Vial\nWhat is Neulasta?\nNeulasta is a prescription medicine that is used:\n in adults and children aged newborn and older to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell\ncount, in people with certain types of cancer (non-myeloid), who receive anti-cancer medicines (chemotherapy) that\ncan cause fever and low blood cell count.\n in adults and children aged newborn and older for acute radiation syndrome. The effectiveness of Neulasta for this\nuse was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people.\nDo not take Neulasta if you have had a serious allergic reaction to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.\nBefore you receive Neulasta, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if\nyou:\n have a sickle cell disorder.\n have kidney problems.\n are allergic to latex. The needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (derived from latex). You\nshould not give Neulasta using the prefilled syringe if you have latex allergies.\n are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Neulasta will harm your unborn baby.\n are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Neulasta passes into your breast milk.\nTell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter\nmedicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nHow will I receive Neulasta?\n Neulasta is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) by a healthcare provider. If your\nhealthcare provider decides that the subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your\ncaregiver, follow the detailed “Instructions for Use” that comes with your Neulasta for information on how\nto prepare and inject a dose of Neulasta using the single-dose prefilled syringe.\n You and your caregiver will be shown how to prepare and inject Neulasta using the single-dose prefilled syringe\nbefore you use it.\n For children weighing less than 99 pounds (45 kg), your healthcare provider will prepare and give the dose of\nNeulasta.\n If you are receiving Neulasta because you are also receiving chemotherapy, the last dose of Neulasta should be\ninjected at least 14 days before and 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy.\n If you miss a dose of Neulasta, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose.\n If you inject too much Neulasta, call your healthcare provider or Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 or go to the\nnearest hospital emergency room right away.\nWhat are possible side effects of Neulasta?\nNeulasta may cause serious side effects, including:\n Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your\nhealthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach area or your left shoulder.\n A serious lung problem called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or\nget emergency help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast\nrate of breathing.\n Serious allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath,\nwheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these\nsymptoms, stop using Neulasta and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away.\n Sickle cell crises in people with sickle cell disorder. You may have a severe sickle cell crisis, which could lead\nto death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty\nbreathing.\n Kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms:\no swelling of your face or ankles\no blood in your urine or dark colored urine\no you urinate less than usual\n Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood count during\ntreatment with Neulasta.\n\n Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood count during\ntreatment with Neulasta. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment\nwith Neulasta.\n Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS). Neulasta can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body’s tissues.\nCLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right\naway if you develop any of the following symptoms:\no swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual\no trouble breathing\no swelling of your stomach area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness\no dizziness or feeling faint\no a general feeling of tiredness\n Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). If you have breast cancer or lung\ncancer, when Neulasta is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or with radiation therapy alone, you may\nhave an increased risk of developing a precancerous blood condition called MDS or a blood cancer called AML.\nCall your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of MDS and AML, including tiredness, fever, or easy\nbruising or bleeding.\n Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel that carries blood from the\nheart to the body) has happened in people who receive Neulasta. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop\nfever, stomach (abdominal) pain, feeling tired, or back pain.\nThe most common side effects of Neulasta are pain in the bones, arms, and legs.\nThese are not all the possible side effects of Neulasta.\nCall your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at\n1-800-FDA-1088.\nHow should I store Neulasta single-dose prefilled syringes?\n Store Neulasta in the refrigerator between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C).\n Do not freeze.\n Keep Neulasta in the original carton to protect from light or physical damage.\n Do not shake Neulasta.\n Take Neulasta out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature, 68°F to 77°F\n(20°C to 25°C), before preparing an injection.\n Throw away (dispose of) any unused Neulasta that has been left at room temperature, 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C),\nfor more than 48 hours.\nKeep Neulasta and all medicines out of the reach of children.\nGeneral information about the safe and effective use of Neulasta.\nMedicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use\nNeulasta for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give Neulasta to other people, even if they have the same\nsymptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about\nNeulasta that is written for health professionals.\nWhat are the ingredients in Neulasta?\nActive ingredient: pegfilgrastim\nInactive ingredients: acetate, polysorbate 20, sodium and sorbitol in water for injection.\nManufactured by:\nAmgen Inc., One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799\nU.S. License No. 1080\nPatent: http://pat.amgen.com/onpro/\n©2002- 2025 Amgen Inc.

      "reference_material_content": "Carpal tunnel syndrome\nOverview\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions. It is caused by pressure\non the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway\nsurrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. When the median nerve is\ncompressed, symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the thumb and\nfingers.\nWrist anatomy, health conditions and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal\ntunnel syndrome.\nProper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores hand function.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include:\nTingling and numbness. Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. Usually\nthe thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. You might\nhave a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. These symptoms often occur while\nholding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep.\nThe sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm.\nMany people \"shake out\" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may\nbecome constant over time.\nWeakness. People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and\ndrop objects. This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching\nmuscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that interfere\nwith your usual activities and sleep patterns. Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur\nwithout treatment.\nCauses\nk\nc\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. b a\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nThe median nerve runs from the forearm through a passageway in the wrist to the hand, known\nas the carpal tunnel. The median nerve provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and all\nof the fingers except the little finger. This nerve also provides signals to move the muscles\naround the base of the thumb. This movement is known as motor function.\nAnything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. This\nalso may occur due to swelling and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis or other\ndiseases.\nMany times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Or the cause may not be\nknown. It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the\ncondition.\nRisk factors\nSeveral factors have been linked with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although they may not directly\ncause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median\nnerve. These include:\nAnatomical factors. A wrist fracture or dislocation can alter the space within the carpal\ntunnel. Arthritis that causes changes to the small bones in the wrist can affect the carpal\ntunnel. These changes can put pressure on the median nerve.\nPeople who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSex assigned at birth. Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This\nmay be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men. Or it may\nbe due to the effect of hormones on the lining of the tendons in the carpal tunnel.\nWomen who have carpal tunnel syndrome also may have smaller carpal tunnels than do\nwomen who don't have the condition.\nNerve-damaging conditions. Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk\nof nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve.\nInflammatory conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and other conditions that cause\nswelling, known as inflammation, can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist. This\ncan put pressure on the median nerve.\nMedicines. Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and\nanastrozole (Arimidex), a medicine used to treat breast cancer.\nObesity. Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nBody fluid changes. Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel,\nirritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal\ntunnel syndrome that happens with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after\npregnancy.\nOther medical conditions. Certain conditions, such as thyroid disorders, kidney failure and\nlymphedema, may increase the chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome.\nk\nWorkplace factors. Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires a c\nb\nd\ne\nrepeated movements that flex the wrist may create pressure on the median nerve. Suche\nF\n\nwork also may worsen existing nerve damage. Pressure on the nerve can be worse if the\nwork is done in a cold environment.\nHowever, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as\ndirect causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSeveral studies have evaluated whether there is a link between computer use and carpal\ntunnel syndrome. Some evidence suggests that mouse use, but not the use of a keyboard,\nmay be related to carpal tunnel syndrome. There has not been enough quality and\nconsistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel\nsyndrome. However, computer use may cause a different form of hand pain.\nPrevention\nThere are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can lessen stress on\nthe hands and wrists with these methods:\nReduce your force and relax your grip. If your work involves a cash register or keyboard,\nfor instance, hit the keys softly.\nTake short, frequent breaks. Gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically.\nAlternate tasks when possible. This is especially important if you use equipment that\nvibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force. Taking a break for even a few\nminutes each hour can make a difference.\nWatch your form. Do not bend your wrist all the way up or down when using a keyboard. A\nrelaxed middle position with the wrists parallel to the floor is best. Keep your keyboard at\nelbow height or slightly lower.\nImprove your posture. The wrong posture can occur when you adjust your body to view a\ncomputer screen rather than adjusting the screen height and distance to a correct posture.\nThe wrong posture rolls shoulders forward, shortens the neck and shoulder muscles, and\ncompresses nerves in the neck. This can cause neck pain and also may bother the hands\nand arms.\nChange your computer mouse. Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable to\nuse and doesn't strain your wrist.\nKeep your hands warm. You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in\na cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that\nkeep the hands and wrists warm.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Peripheral neuropathy\nOverview\nPeripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves that are located outside of the brain and spinal\ncord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. This condition often causes weakness, numbness and\npain, usually in the hands and feet. It also can affect other areas and body functions including\ndigestion and urination.\nThe peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the\ncentral nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. The peripheral nerves\nalso send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves.\nPeripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems,\ninherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is\ndiabetes.\nPeople with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling.\nSometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated.\nMedicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.\nSymptoms\nEvery nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of\nnerves affected. Nerves are divided into:\nSensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from\nthe skin.\nMotor nerves that control muscle movement.\nAutonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate,\ndigestion and bladder function.\nSymptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include:\nGradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations\ncan spread upward into your legs and arms.\nSharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain.\nExtreme sensitivity to touch.\nPain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting\nk\nc\na\nweight on them or when they're under a blanket. b\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nLack of coordination and falling.\nMuscle weakness.\nFeeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not.\nInability to move if motor nerves are affected.\nIf autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include:\nHeat intolerance.\nExcessive sweating or not being able to sweat.\nBowel, bladder or digestive problems.\nDrops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.\nPeripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more\nnerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's\ncalled polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people\nwith peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek medical care right away if you notice unusual tingling, weakness, or pain in your hands or\nfeet. Early diagnosis and treatment give you the best chance for controlling your symptoms and\npreventing further damage to your peripheral nerves.\nCauses\nPeripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by several different conditions. Health\nconditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include:\nAutoimmune diseases. These include Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,\nGuillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitis.\nAlso, some cancers related to the body's immune system can cause polyneuropathy. These\nare a form of autoimmune disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome.\nDiabetes and metabolic syndrome. This is the most common cause. Among people with\ndiabetes, more than half will develop some type of neuropathy.\nInfections. These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease,\nshingles, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV.\nInherited disorders. Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types\nof neuropathy that run in families.\nTumors. Cancerous growths, also called malignant, and noncancerous growths, also called\nbenign, can grow on or press on nerves.\nBone marrow disorders. These include a protein in the blood that isn't usually there, called\nmonoclonal gammopathies, a rare form of myeloma that affects the bones, lymphoma and\nthe rare disease amyloidosis.\nOther diseases. These include metabolic conditions such as kidney disease or liver\ndisease, and an underactive thyroid, also known as hypothyroidism. k\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\nOther causes of neuropathies include: e\nF\n\nAlcohol use disorder. Unhealthy dietary choices made by people with alcohol use disorder,\nalso known as alcoholism, and poor absorption of vitamins can lead to low amounts of\nessential vitamins in the body.\nExposure to poisons. Toxic substances include industrial chemicals and heavy metals\nsuch as lead and mercury.\nMedicines. Certain medicines, especially chemotherapy used to treat cancer, can cause\nperipheral neuropathy.\nInjury or pressure on the nerve. Injuries, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or\nsports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can result from\nhaving a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times.\nLow vitamin levels. B vitamins, including B-1, B-6 and B-12, as well as copper and vitamin\nE are crucial to nerve health.\nIn some cases, no cause can be identified. This is called idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.\nRisk factors\nPeripheral neuropathy risk factors include:\nDiabetes, especially if your sugar levels are not controlled well.\nAlcohol misuse.\nLow levels of vitamins in the body, especially vitamin B-12.\nInfections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, hepatitis B and C, and HIV.\nAutoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system\nattacks your own tissues.\nKidney, liver or thyroid disorders.\nExposure to toxins.\nRepetitive motion, such as those performed for certain jobs.\nFamily history of neuropathy.\nComplications\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy can include:\nBurns, skin injuries and wounds on the feet. You might not feel temperature changes or\npain on parts of your body that are numb.\nInfection. Your feet and other areas that lack sensation can become injured without your\nknowing. Check these areas regularly, wear close-toed, well-fitting shoes and treat minor\ninjuries before they become infected, especially if you have diabetes.\nFalls. Weakness and loss of sensation may be associated with lack of balance and falling.\nInstalling handrails in the bathroom, using canes or walkers when needed, and ensuring that\nyou are walking only in well-lit rooms can decrease fall risk.\nPrevention k\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nManage underlying conditions\nThe best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to manage medical conditions that put you at\nrisk.\nMake healthy lifestyle choices\nThese habits support your nerve health:\nEat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein to keep nerves\nhealthy. Protect against low levels of vitamin B-12 by eating meats, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy\nfoods and fortified cereals. If you're vegetarian or vegan, fortified cereals are a good source\nof vitamin B-12, but talk to your health care professional about B-12 supplements.\nExercise regularly. With a health care professional's OK, try to get at least 30 minutes to\none hour of exercise at least three times a week.\nAvoid factors that may cause nerve damage. These factors can include repetitive\nmotions, exposure to toxic chemicals, smoking and drinking too much alcohol.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\n(BPPV)\nOverview\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also called BPPV, is one of the most common causes of\nvertigo. Vertigo is the sudden feeling of spinning or moving.\nBPPV causes brief periods of mild to intense dizziness. Certain changes in the head's position\nmost often set them off. This might happen from tipping the head up or down, lying down, or\nturning over or sitting up in bed.\nAlthough BPPV can be a bother, it's rarely serious. But it can raise the chance of falling. A\nhealthcare professional can treat BPPV during an office visit.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also called BPPV, may include:\nDizziness.\nA sense of spinning or moving or that the area around you is spinning or moving. This is\ncalled vertigo.\nA loss of balance or not being steady.\nStomach upset and vomiting.\nThe symptoms of BPPV can come and go. Symptoms most often last less than a minute. Bouts\nof BPPV can go away for some time and then come back.\nWhat type of head movement brings on BPPV varies from person to person. But a change in\nhead position almost always is what brings on the symptoms. Some people also feel off balance\nwhen standing or walking.\nAtypical rhythmic eye movements, called nystagmus, most often go with the symptoms of\nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have dizziness or vertigo that is sudden, intense, lasts\nlong or keeps coming back.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\nSeek emergency care e\ne\nF\n\nIt's not common for BPPV to signal a serious illness. But see your healthcare professional right\naway if you have dizziness or vertigo with any of the following:\nA new, different or bad headache.\nA fever.\nSeeing double or not being able to see well.\nHearing loss.\nTrouble talking.\nWeakness in the leg or arm.\nPassing out.\nFalling or trouble walking.\nNumbness or tingling.\nCauses\nOften, there's no known cause for BPPV. This is called idiopathic BPPV.\nWhen there is a known cause, BPPV may be linked with a blow to the head. Less common\ncauses of BPPV include conditions that damage the inner ear.\nRarely, the cause can be damage that happens during ear surgery. Or the symptoms can result\nfrom being on your back for a time, such as during surgery or bed rest.\nThe ear's role\nInside the ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth. It includes three loop-shaped\nstructures called semicircular canals. They have fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that detect the\nhead's movement.\nOther structures in the ear, called otolith organs, detect the head's movements up and down,\nright and left, back and forth. The otolith organs hold crystals that respond to gravity.\nFor many reasons, these crystals can move out of place. When the crystals move, they can go\ninto one of the semicircular canals. Certain head movements can cause the crystals to move.\nWhen the crystals move, they cause the semicircular canal to become sensitive to certain head\nposition changes. This is what causes the dizziness.\nRisk factors\nThe risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is higher in people age 50 and older. But it can\nhappen at any age. The condition is more common in people assigned female at birth.\nA head injury or any other condition of the balance organs of the ear may raise the risk of BPPV.\nThe bone-thinning condition osteoporosis also might be a risk factor.\nComplications\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nBPPV rarely causes complications. The dizziness of BPPV can make you unsteady, which may\nraise your risk of falling and injury from falls.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Thoracic outlet syndrome\nOverview\nThoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions in which there's pressure on blood\nvessels or nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. This space is known as the\nthoracic outlet. Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck\npain. It also can cause numbness in the fingers.\nCommon causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include trauma from a car accident, repetitive\ninjuries from a job or sport, and pregnancy. Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or\nirregular rib, also can cause TOS. Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not\nknown.\nTreatment often involves physical therapy and pain relief. Most people improve with these\ntreatments. For some, surgery may be recommended.\nSymptoms\nThere are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome:\nNeurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the most common type of thoracic outlet\nsyndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The\nnerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle\nmovements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand.\nVenous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one\nor more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in\nblood clots.\nArterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when\none of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury\nto the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation.\nThoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are\ncompressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:\nNumbness or tingling in the arm or fingers.\nPain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand.\nArm fatigue with activity.\nA weakening grip. c k\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nSymptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: F\n\nA change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers.\nHand or arm pain and swelling.\nSymptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\nA pulsating lump near the collarbone.\nCold fingers, hands or arms.\nHand and arm pain.\nA change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand.\nWeak or no pulse in the affected arm.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you regularly experience any of the symptoms of thoracic\noutlet syndrome.\nCauses\nThoracic outlet syndrome is often caused by compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the\nthoracic outlet, the area between the neck and shoulder. The cause of the compression varies\nand can include:\nDifferences in anatomy. Some people are born with an extra rib in the neck found above\nthe first rib. The extra rib, known as a cervical rib, can compress nerves or blood vessels.\nThere also may be a tight fibrous band connecting the spine to the rib that causes\ncompression.\nPoor posture. Drooping your shoulders or holding your head in a forward position can\ncause compression in the thoracic outlet area.\nTrauma. A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then\ncompress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic\naccident often is delayed.\nRisk factors\nThere are several factors that seem to increase the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome, including:\nSex. Women are more than three times more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic outlet\nsyndrome than are men.\nAge. Thoracic outlet syndrome may occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in\nadults between the ages of 20 and 50.\nComplications\nComplications from this condition stem from the type of thoracic outlet syndrome. If you have\nswelling or a painful discoloration in the arm, it is important to seek urgent medical attention.\nYou may need treatment for blood clots or an aneurysm.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nFor neurogenic TOS, repetitive nerve compression can result in long-term injury resulting in\nchronic pain or disability. Neurogenic TOS can be confused for other joint or muscle injuries. If\nsymptoms don't improve, it is important to seek medical attention for an evaluation and testing.\nPrevention\nIf you're at risk of thoracic outlet compression, avoid repetitive movements and lifting heavy\nobjects. If you're overweight, losing weight may help you prevent or relieve symptoms of\nthoracic outlet syndrome.\nEven if you don't have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, avoid carrying heavy bags over\nyour shoulder. This can increase pressure on the thoracic outlet. Stretch daily, and do exercises\nthat keep your shoulder muscles strong and flexible.\nDaily stretches focusing on the chest, neck and shoulders can help improve shoulder muscle\nstrength and prevent thoracic outlet syndrome.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Amyloidosis\nOverview\nAmyloidosis (am-uh-loi-DO-sis) is a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid\nbuilds up in organs. This amyloid buildup can affect the way organs work.\nAmyloidosis may affect the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system, soft tissue, muscle\nand digestive tract.\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis. Some occur with other diseases and improve\nwith treatment. Other types may lead to life-threatening organ failure.\nTreatments may include chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer. Other medicines can\nreduce amyloid production and manage symptoms. Some people may benefit from organ or\nblood stem cell transplants.\nSymptoms\nYou may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease.\nSymptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.\nCommon symptoms of amyloidosis may include:\nSerious fatigue and weakness.\nShortness of breath.\nNumbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet.\nSwelling of the ankles and legs.\nAdditional symptoms may include:\nDizziness.\nLow blood pressure.\nDiarrhea, possibly with blood.\nConstipation.\nNausea and loss of appetite.\nWeight loss.\nAn enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge.\nk\nc\nSkin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and dark or purple patches around the b a\nd\ne\neyes. F e\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you regularly experience any of the symptoms associated\nwith amyloidosis.\nCauses\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused\nby outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect\nmultiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body.\nTypes of amyloidosis include:\nAL amyloidosis, also called immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. This is one of the\nmost common types of amyloidosis in developed countries. AL amyloidosis used to be called\nprimary amyloidosis. It often affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves. It can be associated\nwith multiple myeloma or other blood conditions.\nWild-type ATTR amyloidosis, also called transthyretin amyloidosis. This type also has\nbeen called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when the transthyretin protein, also called\nTTR, made by the liver produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis\ntends to affect men over age 60 and often targets the heart. It also can cause carpal tunnel\nsyndrome.\nHereditary ATTR amyloidosis, also called familial transthyretin amyloidosis. This\ninherited condition often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens\nwith changes to the TTR protein made by your liver. This altered protein is passed down\nthrough families.\nOther hereditary forms of amyloidosis. There are other hereditary forms of amyloidosis.\nThese are more rare. They can affect different organs, depending on the type and how\nproteins are affected. Examples include apolipoprotein A-1 amyloidosis, gelsolin amyloidosis\nand fibrinogen amyloidosis.\nAA amyloidosis. This is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's often triggered by a\nchronic inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the\nkidneys, liver and spleen.\nLocalized amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis has a better prognosis than varieties that\naffect multiple organ systems. It is, however, not common. Typical sites for localized\namyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so\ntreatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.\nRisk factors\nFactors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include:\nAge. Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are over the age of 50.\nSex assigned at birth. Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.\nOther diseases. Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of\nk\nAA amyloidosis. c\na\nb\nd\ne\nFamily history. Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary. e\nF\n\nDialysis. Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis,\ncertain proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This\ncondition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.\nRace. People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a version of the TTR\nprotein that is associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.\nComplications\nAmyloidosis can seriously damage the:\nHeart. Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is\npumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the\nheart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart\nproblems can become life-threatening.\nKidneys. Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove\nwaste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.\nNervous system. Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and\nfeet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of\nalternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can\nmake people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Patient information factsheet\nSleep hygiene\nThis factsheet explains what sleep hygiene is, why it is so important and what you can\ndo to help improve the quality of your sleep. We hope it will help to answer some of the\nquestions you may have. If you have any further questions or concerns, please speak\nto a member of your healthcare team.\nWhat is sleep hygiene?\nYour bedroom environment and your habits (behaviours) during the day, as well as your\nhabits before you go to bed, all play a role in how well you sleep.\n‘Sleep hygiene’ is the term used to describe healthy habits that you can practice during the\nday to help you get a good night’s sleep.\nWhy is good sleep hygiene important?\nSleep is essential for your physical and mental wellbeing. It allows your body time to recharge\nand your mind to process information. Without enough quality sleep, our brains are unable to\nfunction properly.\nGood sleep hygiene can help improve your sleep quality, which in turn can:\n• improve your mood\n• improve your concentration and memory\n• prevent you from developing sleep disorders (such as insomnia)\n• help you maintain a healthy weight\n• lower your risk of developing serious health conditions (such as diabetes and heart disease)\n• help your body fight off diseases\nWhat are the signs of poor sleep hygiene?\nIf you have poor sleep hygiene, you may:\n• find it difficult to fall asleep\n• wake up several times during the night\n• feel tired during the day\nHow can I improve my sleep hygiene?\nWe have included some simple lifestyle changes below. You can make these changes during\nthe day and just before you go to bed to help improve your sleep hygiene, which will help you\nget the best possible night’s sleep.\nKeep regular sleep hours\nGoing to bed and getting up at roughly the same time every day (including on weekends and\nfree days) will help regulate your body clock and will train your body to rest and remain alert at\ncertain times of the day.\n1\nwww.uhs.nhs.uk\n\nPatient information factsheet\nCreate a restful bedroom environment\nYou can do this by:\n• keeping the room temperature at a comfortable level (a very warm room is more likely to\ndisrupt your sleep)\n• keeping the room as dark as possible\n• keeping the room as quiet as possible or using earplugs\nOnly use your bedroom for sleep, sex and getting dressed\nAvoid watching television, listening to the radio or reading in bed. This will help your brain to\nrecognise your bed as a place for sleeping.\nStop using electronic devices before going to bed\nThis includes computers, smartphones and televisions, as they can all stimulate your brain for\nseveral hours after use, making falling asleep difficult.\nAvoid stimulants after lunch\nCaffeine can take up to six hours to wear off, so avoid anything containing caffeine after 2pm.\nThis includes coffee, tea, energy drinks and chocolate.\nNicotine is a stimulant and will keep you awake, so avoid smoking before going to bed.\nAlcohol may make you feel drowsy, but it does not improve sleep quality and will make you\nneed the toilet more often than usual, which will disrupt your sleep. Avoid drinking alcohol\nbefore going to bed and try not to rely on it to help you fall asleep.\nEat a light meal before going to bed\nGoing to bed too full can force your digestive system to keep working when it should be\nresting. Likewise, going to bed hungry can also disturb your sleep.\nExercise regularly during the day\nExercising during the day can help you have a better night’s sleep. However, vigorous\nexercise within three hours of going to bed may delay your sleep. Try doing a relaxing\nexercise before going to bed to help you sleep, such as yoga.\nGet regular exposure to natural light\nMorning and early afternoon light exposure will help you to maintain a healthy sleep-wake\ncycle. Too much light exposure in the evening can prevent you from feeling sleepy.\nCreate a relaxing bedtime routine\nWhen you are stressed or anxious, your body produces more cortisol (the stress hormone).\nGive yourself one to one and a half hours to wind down before going to sleep. Try meditating\nor having a warm bath before going to bed.\nLimit or avoid taking naps during the day\nStaying awake during the day will make you more likely to fall asleep at night. Taking a nap\nlate afternoon or in the evening is likely to affect the quality of your night-time sleep. If you do\ntake a daytime nap, this should be no more than 30 minutes.\n2\nwww.uhs.nhs.uk\n\nPatient information factsheet\nDon’t force yourself to try to go to sleep\nThis is likely to make you more alert. Remove or hide any clocks from your view so you are\nnot constantly checking the time. If you are unable to sleep within 30 minutes of going to bed,\nget up, go to a different room and do something relaxing for a short while (avoid anything with\nbright lights). Return to your bedroom when you feel sleepy. Repeat this as many times as\nnecessary during the night.\nThe key to good sleep hygiene is consistency. Find out what tips work best for you and create\nyour own sleep hygiene checklist to help you get the best sleep possible each night.\nHow much sleep do I need?\nThere is no set rule as to how much sleep you need. The amount of sleep needed varies from\nperson to person.\nSleep patterns can also vary with age, with older people often needing less sleep than\nyounger adults.\n3\nVersion 1.

If your kidneys are not working so well, some\nchanges in the diet help you feel better.\nImportance of Good Nutrition for\nPeople with Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nMaking healthy food choices is important to us\nall, and especially if you have chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD). Good nutrition helps:\nSlow down the progression of kidney disease\n\nProvide energy to do your daily tasks\nPrevent infection\nMaintain muscle mass and strength\nMaintain a healthy weight\nThe Basics of Good Nutrition\nA well-balanced diet gives you the right\namounts of protein, calories, vitamins, and\nminerals each day. Eating a healthy diet, staying\nphysically active, and taking all your medicines\nas prescribed are all important parts to keeping\nyou healthy and feeling well.\n\nChanges to My Diet\nYour kidneys help keep the right balance of\nnutrients and minerals in your body. But if you\nhave kidney disease, your kidneys may not do\nthis job very well. You may need to make some\nchanges to your diet.\nThere is not only one correct eating plan for\neveryone with kidney disease. What you can or\ncannot eat may change over time, depending\non your kidney function and other factors. If you\nare following a certain eating plan for diabetes\nor heart disease, you will continue to do so.\nWhat is good for your diabetes and heart is\ngood for your kidney. A kidney dietitian will help\nyou combine these eating plans.\n\nPeople with CKD may need to control the\namount or type of one or more nutrients:\nSodium\nPotassium\nPhosphorus\nCalcium\nProtein\nEating the right amount or type of one or more\nof these nutrients may help control the buildup\nof waste and fluid in your blood. This means\nyour kidneys do not have to work as hard to\nremove the extra waste and fluid. If your kidney\ndisease gets worse, you may need to limit other\nnutrients as well. Your dietitian or healthcare\nprovider will tell you if you need to do this\nbased on your blood test results.\nSodium and your CKD Diet: How to Spice\nUp Your Cooking\nHealthy kidneys control how much sodium is in\nyour body. If your kidneys do not work well, too\nmuch sodium can cause fluid buildup, swelling,\nhigher blood pressure, and strain on your heart.\nYour dietitian or healthcare provider can tell you\n\nthe right amount of sodium you should have\neach day.\nPotassium\nPotassium is important for muscle function,\nincluding the heart muscle. Too much or too\nlittle potassium in the blood can be very\ndangerous. The amount of potassium you need\nis based on how well your kidneys are working\nand your medications. Your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider can tell you about foods\nwith potassium and the right amount for you to\neat each day.\nPotassium from animal foods is absorbed at a\nhigher rate than potassium from plants.\nElevated blood sugars can also increase\npotassium levels. Some high-potassium foods\ninclude milk, meat, bananas, oranges and\norange juice, cantaloupe, dried fruits, winter\nsquash and salt substitutes.\nPhosphorus and Your Diet\nAs kidney function gets lower, extra\nphosphorus can start building up in the blood.\nHigh phosphorus levels can cause bones to get\nweaker. Your dietitian or healthcare provider\n\ncan tell you if you need to limit goods that are\nhigh in phosphorus.\nHigh phosphorus foods include dairy products,\norgan meats, colas, deli meats, and processed\nfoods with phosphate additives.\nAvoid processed foods that have additives with\nPHOS like disodium PHOSphate. You can find\nthese additives in the ingredients list on food\nlabels.\nCalcium\nFoods that are good sources of calcium are\noften high in phosphorus. Your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider will tell you if you need to\nlimit calcium. Before taking any over-the-\ncounter vitamin D or calcium supplements, talk\nto your healthcare provider.\nProtein\n\nYour body needs protein to help build muscle,\nrepair tissue, and fight infection. Plant-based\nprotein like beans and nuts are easier on the\nkidneys than animal proteins like meat and\ndairy products. This is because plant proteins\nproduce less acid in the body than meat\nproteins. More acid in body can damage the\nkidneys.\nHaving very large amounts of protein,\nespecially in the form of unnecessary\nsupplements, can be stressful on the kidneys.\nBut if protein intake is too low, you can lose\nmuscle mass, become weak, and increase the\nbody’s acid load, so it is important to eat the\nright amount each day. The amount of protein\nyou need is based on:\nYour weight\nYour age – growing children and adolescents,\nand older people, need more protein\nThe amount of protein in your urine, and\ndepending on your type of kidney disease\nYour dietitian or healthcare provider can tell\nyou how much protein you should eat.\nFluids\n\nThe Dos and Don'ts of Fluid Management in\nChronic Kidney Disease\nMost people in the early stages of kidney\ndisease do not need to limit how much fluid\nthey drink. If you do not know your stage of\nkidney disease, ask your healthcare provider. If\nyour kidney disease worsens, your dietitian or\nhealthcare provider can let you know if you\nneed to limit fluids and how much to drink each\nday. Fluids may need to be limited based on\nhow much urine you make each day, and if fluid\nbuild-up in your body is causing swelling or\nstress on your heart or lungs.\nFluids include any food that is liquid at room\ntemperature such as beverages, soups, gelatin,\nfrozen desserts, and ice.\nCalories\nEvery person is different in terms of the calories\nthey need each day. Calories are like fuel. If you\ndon’t eat enough, your body will take protein\nfrom the muscles for energy. It’s important to\nmake sure you get the right number of calories.\nIf you don’t, you may get weak and damage\nyour kidneys. Eating the right number of\ncalories will:\n\nHelp you stay at a healthy weight\nGive you the energy to do your daily tasks\nHelp your body use the protein in food to\nbuild muscle and tissues\nToo many calories can cause extra weight gain,\nwhich can burden the kidneys. If you are\noverweight, some weight loss may be helpful. If\nweight loss is desired or you have diabetes, you\nshould meet with a dietitian to set up a plan\nbased on your kidney blood tests, current food\nchoices, and daily activities.\nVitamins and Minerals\nVitamins and Minerals in Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nMost people get enough vitamins and minerals\nto stay healthy by eating a variety of foods each\nday. But kidney patients may need to limit some\nof these foods. If so, you may need to take\nspecial vitamin or mineral supplements, but\nonly if a dietitian or healthcare provider tells\nyou to. Some vitamins or mineral supplements\nmay be harmful to people with kidney disease.\nYou should check with your healthcare provider\n\nbefore taking any medications you can buy\nwithout a prescription. Some supplements may\nbe harmful to people with kidney disease. Over\nthe counter vitamin and mineral supplements\nmay contain too much phosphorous and\npotassium. You should also avoid taking herbal\nsupplements."

      "reference_material_content": "Here's how you know\nChild Tax Credit\nThe Child Tax Credit helps families with qualifying children get a tax\nbreak. You may be able to claim the credit even if you don't normally\nfile a tax return.\nThe Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a non-refundable credit that allows\npeople with a qualifying child to reduce their tax liability.\nThe Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) is a refundable part of the\nCTC. ACTC allows certain taxpayers who are eligible for the CTC to\nreceive a refund if the CTC is more than their tax liability.\nCredit for Other Dependents (ODC) is a non-refundable credit for\ntaxpayers with dependents who are not eligible for the CTC/ACTC.\nWho qualifies for the Child Tax\nCredit/Additional Child Tax Credit\nTo qualify for the Child Tax Credit, you (or your spouse, if married filing\njointly,) and each qualifying child must have a Social Security number\nthat is valid for employment in the United States and issued before the\n\ndue date of the tax return (including extensions).\nAdditionally, to be a qualifying child for the 2025 tax year, your child\ngenerally must:\nBe under 17 at the end of the tax year.\nBe your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother,\nsister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a\ndescendant of one of these (for example, a grandchild, niece or\nnephew).\nNot provide more than half of his or her own support for the tax\nyear.\nHave lived with you for more than half the tax year.\nBe claimed as a dependent on your return.\nNot file a joint return for the year (or filed the joint return only to\nclaim a refund of taxes withheld or estimated taxes).\nBe a U.S. citizen, U.S. National or a U.S. resident alien.\nThe Child Tax Credit is worth up to $2,200 per qualifying child. If you\nhave little or no federal income tax liability, you may qualify for the\nAdditional Child Tax Credit, up to $1,700 per qualifying child depending\non your income. You must have earned income of at least $2,500 to be\neligible for the ACTC.\nYou qualify for the full amount of the Child Tax Credit for each\nqualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual\nincome is not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return).\nParents and guardians with higher incomes may be eligible to claim a\npartial credit.\n\nIf you claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional\nChild Tax Credit (ACTC), the IRS cannot issue these refunds before mid-\nFebruary. This applies to the entire refund, even the portion not\nassociated with these credits. Check Where’s My Refund in mid-to late\nFebruary for your personalized refund date. Where's My Refund is\nupdated once a day and remains the best way to check the status of\nyour refund.\nWho qualifies for the Credit for Other\nDependents\nIf you do not meet the criteria to claim the Child Tax Credit or\nAdditional Child Tax Credit, you may qualify for the Credit for Other\nDependents (ODC) for your child or dependent. They must:\nBe claimed as a dependent on your tax return.\nBe a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.\nHave a Social Security number, Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN), or Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN).\nThe maximum credit amount is $500 for each dependent and begins to\ndecrease in value if your adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000\n($400,000 for married filing jointly).\nHow to determine eligibility and claim the\ncredits\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see if you’re eligible to claim the\nCTC, ACTC or ODC.\n\nIf you qualify, claim the CTC/ACTC or ODC by entering your children and\nother dependents on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,\nand attaching a completed Schedule 8812, Credits for Qualifying\nChildren and Other Dependents\nInformation if we audit or deny your claim:\nI received a letter from IRS about my credit: What should I do?\nWhat to do if we deny your claim\nOther tax credits for families\nIf you qualify for the Child Tax Credit, you may also qualify for these tax\ncredits:\nChild and Dependent Care Credit\nEarned Income Tax Credit\nAdoption Credit and Adoption Assistance Programs\nEducation credits\nResources\nChild Tax Credit\nAvoid common CTC, ACTC and ODC errors\nTax benefits eligibility chart\nFind tax information for parents"

The main difference between them is that secured\ncredit cards require a security deposit, while unsecured cards do\nnot. Let's dive into how each card works and how to choose the\nright one based on your credit history.\nSecured vs. Unsecured Credit Card\n\nSecured Credit Card Unsecured Credit Card\nSecurity Refundable deposit Not required\ndeposit required, usually $200 to\n$5,000\nIdeal for Individuals with thin or People with an\npoor credit established credit history\nand students\nInitial Lower; based your deposit Higher; based on your\ncredit limit credit score, income and\ncredit history\nCredit limit Limited; may require Based on income and\nincrease additional security deposit account history\nInterest Usually higher than Varies\nrates average\nFees May include late fees, May include late fees,\nannual fees and balance annual fees and balance\ntransfer or cash advance transfer or cash advance\nfees fees\nRewards Common Common\nLow intro Rare More common\nAPR offers\nCredit card Fewer options available More options available\noptions\n\nWhat Is a Secured Credit Card?\nA secured credit card is a card that requires you to make a\nrefundable deposit when you open the account. This deposit,\nwhich might range from around $200 to $5,000, is collateral and\nusually determines your credit limit. The deposit is typically held\nin a linked savings account at the same bank until you either\nupgrade to an unsecured card or close your account.\nIf you default on the balance, your card issuer can use your\nsecurity deposit to cover what you owe.\nBecause the deposit reduces the card issuer's risk, secured\ncredit cards are easier to qualify for if you have limited credit or\npoor credit. Over time, using your account responsibly can help\nyou build or rebuild your credit.\n\nWhat Is an Unsecured Credit Card?\nAn unsecured credit card is the traditional type of credit card.\nApproval is based on your income and overall creditworthiness,\nand no deposit is required. Periodically, card issuers review your\n\naccount and may offer a credit limit increase if you qualify\nbased on your income and account history. You can also\nrequest a credit limit increase after several months of\nresponsible use.\nIf you fall behind on payments, the card issuer will first try to\ncollect the balance from you directly before potentially sending\nthe debt to a collection agency, which could hurt your credit\nscore.\nLearn more: Best Credit Cards for Building Credit\nIs a Secured or Unsecured Card\nBetter for Building Credit?\nBoth secured and unsecured credit cards can help you build\ncredit depending on how responsibly you use them. The key\ndifferences are the approval requirements.\nIf you have no credit or bad credit, a secured credit card is often\nthe better choice because you're more likely to be approved.\nOnce the card is active, you can build credit as long as the\nissuer reports to the three major credit bureaus (Experian,\nEquifax and TransUnion) and you make payments on time. You\nmay even eventually be able to transition your secured card into\na traditional unsecured credit card.\n\nIf you already have good credit and a steady income, an\nunsecured credit card may be a better option, especially if you\nwant more features and choices. You'll likely qualify for lower\ninterest rates, higher limits and rewards, and you won't have to\nmake a security deposit.\nTip: Being added as an authorized user on\nsomeone else's credit card can help you start\nbuilding your credit history to qualify for an\nunsecured card. You'll benefit from that credit\ncard's positive history without having to manage the\naccount yourself or worry about qualifying on your\nown.\nShould I Get a Secured or Unsecured\nCredit Card?\nWhether or not you want to get a secured credit card or an\nunsecured credit card depends on your personal credit profile,\nhow you plan to use the card and any features you'd find helpful\nto have. Here's how you can decide which credit card is better\nfor you.\nWhen to Consider Getting a Secured\nCredit Card\n\nYou have little or no credit history. The security deposit\nserves as collateral, making approval easier without relying\non your credit score.\nYou're trying to repair your credit. If you've had late\npayments, collections or bankruptcy, a secured credit card\nhelps you reestablish a positive payment history.\nYou've been denied an unsecured credit card. If you've had\na credit application turned down, using a secured card\nresponsibly allows you to improve your credit profile and\nqualify for better credit cards later.\nYou can afford a security deposit. Deposits typically start\naround $200, but can go higher depending on the card and\nyour desired credit limit. If you can afford it, a higher credit\nlimit gives you more spending flexibility.\nLearn more: How Much Should You Deposit for a Secured\nCard?\nWhen to Consider Getting an\nUnsecured Credit Card\nYou have a well-established credit history. A solid payment\nhistory and decent credit score make it easier to qualify for\nunsecured cards with better terms.\n\nYou want higher credit limits and more flexibility.\nUnsecured cards often offer higher credit limits, making it\neasier to make larger purchases and keep a low credit\nutilization ratio.\nYou want premium benefits. While some secured cards\noffer minimal benefits, an unsecured card is the better\noption for higher rewards, purchase protection, travel\ninsurance and extended warranties.\nYou want a 0% intro annual percentage rate (APR). With\nestablished credit, you may qualify for an intro 0% APR\npromotion, which can allow you to pay off a balance\ntransfer or large purchase interest-free.\nYou want to keep your money accessible. Since there's no\ndeposit, your money stays available for savings or\nemergencies.\nYou've managed a secured credit card responsibly. After\nseveral months of on-time payments, you may qualify for an\nunsecured credit card.\nTip: If you're in the market for a new credit card,\nExperian can help you get matched with credit\ncards that fit your unique credit profile. You'll be\nable to compare interest rates, features and more\nbefore deciding.\n\nHow to Upgrade From a Secured to\nan Unsecured Credit Card\nMany card issuers review secured accounts after six to 12\nmonths to determine whether you qualify for an upgrade to an\nunsecured credit card. There are several ways to improve your\nchances of an automatic upgrade.\nMake your payments on time. Payment history is the most\nimportant factor in your credit score. Paying on time shows\nyour card issuer you can manage credit responsibly.\nKeep your balance low. Using your card for small\npurchases and paying them off helps maintain a low credit\nutilization, which helps your credit. Maxing out your card or\ngoing over the credit limit can make it harder to get\nupgraded.\nMinimize new credit applications. Opening new credit\ncards and loans impacts your credit score and potentially\nincreases your debt. Each time you open a new credit\naccount, the hard inquiry that appears on your credit report\nas part of the application process can temporarily decrease\nyour credit scores a few points; repeat inquiries for credit\ncards compound the impact on your scores."

The combined holdings the mutual\nfund owns are known as its portfolio, which is\nmanaged by an SEC-registered investment adviser.\nEach mutual fund share represents an investor’s\npart ownership of the mutual fund’s portfolio and\nthe gains and losses the portfolio generates.\nInvestors in mutual funds buy their shares from,\nand sell/redeem their shares to, the mutual funds\nthemselves or through investment professionals\nlike brokers or investment advisers.\n\nWhy do people buy mutual funds?\nMutual funds are a popular choice among investors\nbecause they generally offer the following features:\nProfessional Management.

A fund may earn income\nfrom its portfolio – for example, dividends on\n\nstock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays\nthe shareholders nearly all the income, less\nexpenses, as a dividend payment.\nCapital Gains Distributions. The price of the\nsecurities a fund owns may increase. When a\nfund sells a security that has increased in\nprice, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of\nthe year, the fund distributes these capital\ngains, minus any capital losses, to investors.\nIncreased Net Asset Value (NAV). If the\nmarket value of a fund’s portfolio increases,\nafter deducting expenses and liabilities, then\nthe NAV of the fund and its shares increases.\nWith respect to dividend payments and capital\ngains distributions, mutual funds usually will\ngive investors a choice. The mutual fund can\ntransfer the amount to the investor, or the\ninvestor can have the dividends or\ndistributions reinvested in the mutual fund to\nbuy more shares.\nWhat are the risks of investing in mutual\nfunds?\nMutual funds are not guaranteed or insured by the\nFDIC or any other government agency. They\ntherefore all carry some level of risk. You may lose\nsome or all of the money you invest because the\ninvestments held by a fund can go down in value.\n\nDividends or interest payments may also change as\nmarket conditions change.\nA fund’s past performance is not as important as\nyou might think because past performance does\nnot predict future returns. But past performance\ncan tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been\nover a period of time. The more volatile the fund,\nthe higher the investment risk.\nDifferent funds have different risks and rewards\ndepending on their investment objectives.\nGenerally, the higher the potential return, the\nhigher the risk of loss.\nWhat do I pay for my mutual fund?\nAs with any business, running a mutual fund\ninvolves costs. Funds pass along these costs to\ninvestors by deducting fees and expenses from\nNAV. That means you pay the fees and expenses\nindirectly.\nFees vary from fund to fund. It is important to\nunderstand what fees a mutual fund charges and\nhow those fees impact your investment. Even small\ndifferences in fees can mean large differences in\nreturns over time. In addition, a fund with high\n\ncosts must perform better than a low-cost fund to\ngenerate the same returns for you.\nRead more at Mutual Fund and ETF Fees and\nExpenses - Investor Bulletin (/introduction-\ninvesting/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-\nbulletins/investor-bulletins-20) to learn about\nsome of the most common mutual fund fees and\nexpenses. Also check out the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (FINRA) Fund Analyzer\n(/financial-tools-calculators/financial-tools/mutual-\nfund-analyzer) to compute how the costs of\ndifferent mutual funds add up over time and eat\ninto your returns.\nWhat are some common mutual fund\ninvesting strategies?\nIndex Funds. Index funds follow a passive\ninvestment strategy that is designed to\nachieve approximately the same return as a\nparticular index before fees. An index fund\nwill attempt to achieve its investment\nobjective primarily by investing in the\nsecurities of companies that are included in a\nselected index. Passive management usually\ntranslates into less trading of the fund’s\nportfolio (fewer transaction costs), more\nfavorable income tax consequences (lower\n\nrealized capital gains), and lower fees than\nactively managed funds.\nActively Managed Funds. Actively managed\nfunds are not based on an index. Instead,\nthey seek to achieve a stated investment\nobjective by investing in a portfolio of stocks,\nbonds, and other assets. An adviser of an\nactively managed fund may actively buy or sell\ninvestments in the portfolio on a daily basis\nwithout regard to conformity with an index.\nBut the trades must be consistent with the\noverall investment objective and strategies of\nthe fund. An actively managed fund has the\npotential to outperform the market or its\nchosen benchmark, but its performance is\nheavily dependent on the skill of the manager.\nWhat types of mutual funds are there?\nMutual funds fall into several main categories. Each\ntype has different features, risks, and rewards.\nStock funds (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/stock-fund) invest primarily in\nstocks or equities. A stock is an instrument\nthat represents an ownership interest (called\nequity) in a company and a proportional share\nin the company’s assets and profits. The types\nof stocks owned by a stock fund depend upon\n\nthe fund’s investment objectives, policies, and\nstrategies. A stock fund’s value can rise and\nfall quickly (and dramatically) over the short\nterm. The fund’s performance depends on\nwhether the underlying companies do well or\nnot.\nBond funds (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/bond-funds-and-income-\nfunds) or income funds invest primarily in\nbonds or other types of debt securities.\nDepending on its investment objectives and\npolicies, a bond fund may concentrate its\ninvestments in a particular type of bond or\ndebt security or a mixture of types. The\nsecurities that bond funds hold will vary in\nterms of risk, return, duration, volatility and\nother features.\nTarget date funds (/news-alerts/investor-\nbulletins/target-date-retirement-funds)\ntypically hold a mix of stock funds, bond funds\nand other funds, and are created for\nindividuals with a particular date for\nretirement or other goal in mind. Target date\nfunds are designed to make investing for\nretirement or other goals more convenient by\nchanging their investment mix as the target\ndate gets closer. However, be aware that if a\ntarget date fund invests in other funds, it may\ncharge a double layer of fees.\n\nMoney market funds (/introduction-\ninvesting/general-resources/news-\nalerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\nbulletins/updated-12) invest in liquid, short-\nterm debt securities, cash and cash\nequivalents. Many investors use money\nmarket funds to store cash or as an\nalternative to bank savings vehicles.\nHow do I buy and sell mutual funds?\nInvestors buy and sell mutual fund shares from/to\nthe fund itself or through a broker or investment\nadviser, rather than from/to other investors on\nnational securities markets. The purchase price is\nthe next calculated NAV, plus any fees charged at\nthe time of purchase. Mutual fund shares are\nredeemable. This means investors can sell the\nshares back to the fund at any time at the next\ncalculated NAV, minus any fees charged at the time\nof redemption.\nWhat should I consider before investing in\nmutual funds?\nBefore investing in a mutual fund, you should\ncarefully read the fund’s available information\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-"

      "reference_material_content": "What is an emergency fund?\nAn emergency fund is a cash reserve that’s specifically set aside\nfor unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some\ncommon examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical\nbills, or a loss of income.\nIn general, emergency savings can be used for large or small\nunplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine\nmonthly expenses and spending.\n\nWhy do I need it?\nWithout savings, a financial shock—even minor—could set you\nback, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting\nimpact.\nResearch suggests that individuals who struggle to recover\nfrom a financial shock have less savings to help protect against\na future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans,\nwhich can lead to debt that’s generally harder to pay off. They\nmay also pull from other savings, like retirement funds, to cover\nthese costs.\nHow much do I need in it?\n\nThe amount you need to have in an emergency savings fund\ndepends on your situation. Think about the most common kind\nof unexpected expenses you’ve had in the past and how much\nthey cost. This may help you set a goal for how much you want\nto have set aside.\nIf you’re living paycheck to paycheck or don’t get paid the same\namount each week or month, putting any money aside can feel\ndifficult. But, even a small amount can provide some financial\nsecurity.\nKeep reading to find the savings strategy, or strategies, that\nwork best for you.\nHow do I build it?\nThere are different strategies to get your savings started. These\nstrategies cover a range of situations, including if you have a\nlimited ability to save or if your pay tends to fluctuate. It may be\nthat you could use all of these strategies, but if you have a\nlimited ability to save, managing your cash flow or putting\n\naway a portion of your tax refund are the easiest ways to get\nstarted.\nStrategy: Create a savings habit\nBuilding a savings of any size is easier when you’re able to\nconsistently put money away. It’s one of the fastest ways to see\nit grow. If you’re not in a regular practice of saving, there are a\nfew key principles to creating and sticking to a savings habit:\nSet a goal. Having a specific goal for your savings (https://fi\nles.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_your-money-you\nr-goals_savings_plan_tool_2018-11_ADA.pdf) can help you\nstay motivated. Establishing your emergency fund may be\nthat achievable goal that helps you stay on track, especially\nwhen you’re initially getting started. Use our savings\nplanning tool (https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/docume\nnts/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_savings_plan_tool_2018-11\n_ADA.pdf) to calculate how long it’ll take you to reach your\ngoal, based on how much and how often you’re able to put\nmoney away.\nCreate a system for making consistent contributions. There\nare a number of different ways to save, and as you’ll read\nbelow, setting up automatic recurring transfers (cfpb.gov/sta\nrt-small-save-up/an-essential-guide-to-building-an-emergenc\ny-fund/#anchor_making-your-saving-automatic) is often one\nof the easiest. It may also be that you put a specific amount\nof cash aside each day, week, or payday period. Aim to make\nit a specific amount, and if you can occasionally afford to do\nmore, you’ll watch your savings grow even faster.\n\nRegularly monitor your progress. Find a way to regularly\ncheck your savings. Whether it’s an automatic notification of\nyour account balance or writing down a running total of your\ncontributions, finding a way to watch your progress can offer\ngratification and encouragement to keep going.\nCelebrate your successes. If you’re sticking with your savings\nhabit, don’t miss the opportunity to recognize what you’ve\naccomplished. Find a few ways that you can treat yourself,\nand if you’ve reached your goal, set your next one.\nWho is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with\nconsistent income. If you know you have a regular paycheck or\nmoney consistently coming in, you can create a habit to put\nsome of that money towards an emergency savings fund.\nStrategy: Manage your cash flow\nYour cash flow (https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/document\ns/cfpb_your-money-your-goals_cash_flow_budget_tool_2018-1\n1_ADA.pdf) is essentially the timing of when your money is\ncoming in (your income) and going out (your expenses and\nspending). If the timing is off, you can find yourself running\nshort at the end of the week or month, but if you’re actively\ntracking it, you’ll start to see opportunities to adjust your\nspending and savings (https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/do\ncuments/cfbp_your-money-your-goals_adjust_cash_flow_tool_\n2018-11_ADA.pdf).\nFor example, you may be able to work with your creditors (like\nyour landlord, utility companies, or credit card companies) to\n\nadjust the due dates for your bills (cfpb.gov/about-us/blog/adju\nsting-your-bill-due-dates-can-help-you-stay-top-your-bills-and-\nmanage-your-cash-flow/), or you can use the weeks when you\nhave more money available to move a little extra into savings.\nWho is this helpful for: Anyone. This is one important first step\nin managing your money, regardless of whether you’re living\npaycheck to paycheck or have a tendency to spend more than\nyour budget allows.\nStrategy: Take advantage of one-time\nopportunities to save\nThere may also be certain times during the year when you get\nan influx of money. For many Americans, a tax refund can be\none of the largest checks they receive all year. There may be\nother times of the year, like a holiday or birthday, that you\nreceive a cash gift.\nWhile it’s tempting to spend it, saving all or a portion of that\nmoney (cfpb.gov/about-us/blog/tax-time-saving-tips/) could\nhelp you quickly set up your emergency fund.\nWho is this helpful for: Anyone but particularly those with\nirregular income. If you receive a large check from a tax refund\nor for some other reason, it’s always good to consider putting\nall or a portion of it away into savings.\n\nStrategy: Make your saving automatic\nSaving automatically (cfpb.gov/about-us/blog/looking-easy-wa\ny-save-money-make-it-automatic/) is one of the easiest ways to\nmake your savings consistent so you start to see it build over\ntime. One common way to do this is to set up recurring\ntransfers through your bank or credit union so money is moved\nautomatically from your checking account to your savings\naccount. You get to decide how much and how often, but once\nyou have it set up, you’ll be making consistent contributions to\nyour savings.\nIt’s a good idea to be mindful of your balances, however, so you\ndon’t incur overdraft fees (cfpb.gov/askcfpb/1035) if there’s not\nenough money in your checking account at the time of the\nautomatic transaction. To help you stay mindful, consider\nsetting up automatic notifications or calendar reminders to\ncheck your balance.\nWho is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with\nconsistent income. Again, you can determine how much and\nhow often to have money transferred between accounts, but\nyou want to make sure you have money coming in. If your\n\nsituation changes or your income changes, you can always\nadjust it.\nStrategy: Save through work\nAnother way to save automatically is through your employer. In\naddition to employer-based contributions for retirement, you\nmay have an option to split your paycheck between your\nchecking and savings accounts. If you receive your paycheck\nthrough direct deposit (cfpb.gov/askcfpb/1027), check with\nyour employer to see if it’s possible to divide it between two\naccounts. If you’re tempted to spend your paycheck when you\nget it, this is an easy way to put money aside without having to\nthink twice.\nWho is this helpful for: Those with consistent income. Again, if\nyou’re getting a check from your employer on a regular basis,\npay yourself first by putting a portion of it automatically into\nsavings."

      "reference_material_content": "Consumer\nAlert\nKnow Your Rights as a California Tenant\nYour Right to a Safe and Well-Maintained Home\n• Your landlord must keep your home “habitable”—meaning, safe and fit to live in. (See, for example, Civil Code, § 1941.1.)\nThis is true regardless of the home’s condition when you moved in. For example, your landlord must provide:\no Working plumbing, including hot and cold water and sewage disposal.\no Safe and working electrical equipment and wiring, including lighting.\no Heating.\no Walls and roofs that keep out rain and wind.\no Unbroken windows and doors, with working locks.\no Working smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors.\no Safe fire or emergency exits.\no Adequate pest control for rodents (like rats) and insects (like roaches and bed bugs).\no Adequate sanitation, including enough trash cans, and clean common areas.\no Floors, stairways, and railings in good repair.\no Repairs to prevent and fix health hazards, such as fire hazards, visible mold, or dampness.\n• You may be responsible for any damage you cause to the home. Tenants must keep their homes sanitary, use appliances as\nintended, and avoid damaging the home. If you damage the home, your landlord may be able to charge you for repairs.\n• You have a right to ask your landlord to repair any unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Request repairs in writing, such as by\ntext message, email, or letter. Keep copies or take photos of all requests for repairs and all communications that you have\nwith your landlord about these repairs. If possible, take videos or photos that show the unsafe or unhealthy conditions.\n• If your landlord refuses to make repairs, seek help right away. Tell your local code enforcement office, local building\ndepartment, or local health department about any unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The city or county should inspect your\nhome and require your landlord to repair any violations that it finds. If you are not sure what agency to call, you can call 211\nor 311 in some cities. You can also seek legal help. See below on how to get legal help.\n• Your landlord may not retaliate against you for seeking repairs. You have a right to ask for repairs, to report health and\nsafety issues to government agencies, and to seek legal help. Your landlord cannot retaliate against you for doing so. Your\nlandlord also cannot threaten to disclose your immigration status to pressure you to move out, or harass or retaliate against\nyou by disclosing your immigration status to law enforcement. (Civil Code, § 1942.5.)\n• You may be entitled to relocation assistance. If the conditions are so bad that your immediate health or safety is in danger,\nthe city or county may make you leave the property immediately. The city or county may also require your landlord to pay\nfor you to relocate to a new home. If you receive a notice from the city or county requiring you to leave your home, ask the\ncode enforcement office about these benefits immediately. (Health & Safety Code, § 17975.)\n• Withholding rent may put you at risk of eviction. If your landlord refuses to make repairs, seek legal help before deciding\nwhether to stop paying rent. Although you may be able to pay for the repair and deduct the cost from your rent, you must\nmeet certain requirements before doing so or it may put you at risk of eviction. (Civil Code, §§ 1942, 1942.5) If you receive\nan eviction notice, it is very important for you to tell your lawyer or the court about any health and safety issues in your\nhome. Provide them with photos or other proof of the problems, such as any documents you received from the city or\ncounty, and of your requests for repairs. (Civil Code, §§ 1942.3, 1942.4; Code of Civil Procedure, § 1174.2.)\nGet legal help as soon as possible if you believe your landlord has violated your tenant rights or if you’re facing eviction.\nIf you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free or low-cost legal aid. To find a legal aid office near where you live, visit\nLawHelpCA.1 Then click on the tab in the middle of the page that says “Find Legal Help,” and enter your county. If you do not\nqualify for legal aid and need help finding a lawyer, visit the California State Bar webpage2 to find a local certified lawyer referral\nservice, or visit the California Courts’ webpage3 for tenants facing evictions.\nFor more information and resources, visit www.oag.ca.gov/housing.\n1 www.lawhelpca.org/issues/housing/landlord-and-tenant-issues\n2 www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Need-Legal-Help/Using-a-Certified-Lawyer-Referral-Service\n3 www.selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/eviction-tenant\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General"

Revisions included increases to the standard salary level\nand the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism for updating these earnings\nthresholds to reflect current earnings data. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated\nthe Department's 2024 final rule. Consequently, with regard to enforcement, the Department is applying the 2019 rule's minimum\nsalary level of $684 per week and total annual compensation requirement for highly compensated employees of $107,432 per year.\nLawsuits regarding the 2024 final rule are currently pending in two other federal district courts, and the United States has filed a\nnotice of appeal from the November 15 decision. The Department will update this notice with additional information as it becomes\navailable.\nThis fact sheet provides general information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the\nFLSA as defined by Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 541.\nThe FLSA requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime\npay at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\nHowever, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona\nfide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain\ncomputer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a\nsalary basis at not less than $684 per week. Employers may use nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions)\npaid on an annual or more frequent basis, to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level. Job titles do not determine exempt status.\nIn order for an exemption to apply, an employee’s specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the Department’s\nregulations.\nSee other fact sheets in this series for more information on the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside\nsales employees, and for more information on the salary basis requirement.\nExecutive Exemption\nTo qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be managing the enterprise, or managing a customarily recognized department or subdivision of\nthe enterprise;\nThe employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of at least two or more other full-time employees or their equivalent; and\nThe employee must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee’s suggestions and recommendations as to the\nhiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given particular weight.\nAdministrative Exemptions\nTo qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general\nbusiness operations of the employer or the employer’s customers; and\nThe employee’s primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\nProfessional Exemption\nTo qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, defined as work which is\npredominantly intellectual in character and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment;\nThe advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and\nThe advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.\nTo qualify for the creative professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week;\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized\nfield of artistic or creative endeavor.\nComputer Employee Exemption\nTo qualify for the computer employee exemption, the following tests must be met:\nThe employee must be compensated either on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684 per week\nor, if compensated on an hourly basis, at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour;\nThe employee must be employed as a computer systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer or other similarly skilled\nworker in the computer field performing the duties described below;\nThe employee’s primary duty must consist of:\n1. The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware,\nsoftware or system functional specifications;\n2. The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs,\nincluding prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;\n3. The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or\n4. A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\n\nBlue-Collar Workers\nThe exemptions provided by FLSA Section 13(a)(1) apply only to “white-collar” employees who meet the salary and duties tests set forth in\nthe Part 541 regulations. The exemptions do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue-collar” workers who perform work involving\nrepetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. FLSA-covered, non-management employees in production, maintenance,\nconstruction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers,\nlongshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the FLSA, and are not\nexempt under the Part 541 regulations no matter how highly paid they might be.\nPolice, Fire Fighters, Paramedics & Other First Responders\nThe exemptions also do not apply to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators,\ninspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians,\nambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank or pay level, who perform\nwork such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires of any type; rescuing fire, crime or accident victims; preventing or detecting\ncrimes; conducting investigations or inspections for violations of law; performing surveillance; pursuing, restraining and apprehending\nsuspects; detaining or supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including those on probation or parole; interviewing witnesses;\ninterrogating and fingerprinting suspects; preparing investigative reports; or other similar work."

      "reference_material_content": "Fact Sheet\nBankruptcy Basics\nWhat is Bankruptcy?\nBankruptcy is a legal process to get rid of or “restructure” debts when you can’t pay them.\n“Restructure” means you change the terms of a debt. Like paying less or taking more time. A\nbankruptcy can lower or erase the amount you owe.\nWhile your bankruptcy case is going through the courts, creditors can’t collect the money you owe\nthem. When you finish your bankruptcy, you get a Discharge Order from the Judge. The Discharge\nOrder says that all debts that qualify for discharge are now discharged. This means you are not\nlegally responsible for these debts anymore. Your creditors get a copy of this Discharge Order from\nthe Court too.\nWhat types of debts can I get rid of through bankruptcy?\n• credit card debt\n• business debt\n• medical bills debt\n• utility bills debt\n• past due rent\n• auto accident claims that don’t involve drunk driving\n• personal loans from family and friends\nAre there some types of debts that I still have to pay?\nEven if you file for bankruptcy, there are certain debts you still have to pay. Some of these debts\nthat don’t go away are:\n• Court fines and penalties\n• Court ordered child support\n• Court ordered alimony\n• Most student loans\n• Most taxes owed to the government\n• Debts for willful and malicious injury to another person or property. These are debts that\nhappened because of deliberate or intentional actions like arson, theft, assault, and\nmurder.\nWhy should I file for bankruptcy?\n• Bankruptcy gives you a fresh start on managing your finances. You should time your\nbankruptcy for when you have a good chance at staying out of debt and can take full\nadvantage of a fresh start.\n2026 • For more fact sheets and other help go to www.LawHelpMN.org • C-21 pg. 1\n\n• Bankruptcy can put a stop to things like garnishments, lawsuits to enforce debt collection,\nand utility cutoffs.\n• If you have debts that you can’t get discharged in bankruptcy, but you have good cash flow,\nbankruptcy can help restructure your payments. Like paying back mortgage arrears (see\nChapter 13 bankruptcies, below).\nWhat are some bad things about bankruptcy?\n• Some of your property might not be protected. It might be sold to pay creditors.\n• Your credit score goes down. A bankruptcy stays in your credit report for up to 10 years and can\nmake it hard to get a loan in the future.\n• A bankruptcy can make getting a job harder.\n• It can sometimes make renting harder.\n• Other people can be affected by your decision to file for bankruptcy. For example, if anyone co-\nsigned a loan with you, they may be held responsible for that debt.\n• If you paid back money to family or friends in the past year, they may have to return it. These\nare called \"preference payments.\" The trustee in charge of your case is likely to tell your family\nand friends that they have to turn the money in. This is so the money can be used to pay your\nother creditors.\nWill I lose my house or car?\nThere are a lot of factors to look at when it comes to your\nhouse and car.\nUsually, the house you live in, and one car are protected\nup to a certain amount of equity. This protection is called\n“exempt.” The amount that is exempt is set by exemption laws.\nBut if your equity is more than the exempt limit, you may have to pay some amount to keep the\nproperty. Or you might have to sell the property to help pay off your debts.\nIf you owe money on a house or car that you get to keep, you still owe that money after your\nbankruptcy. This means that if you miss payments after your bankruptcy is done, your car can still\nbe repossessed, and your house can still go through the foreclosure process.\nHouses and cars can get complicated, so try to talk to a lawyer to see if they are protected.\nC-21 Bankruptcy Basics pg. 2\n\nWhat is the difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy?\nChapter 7 bankruptcy typically gets rid of your debt and lets you\nstart over much faster than Chapter 13. If you have non-exempt\nproperty, it is sold off by the trustee. Nonexempt property are\nthings that aren’t protected. You may be able to pay the trustee\nmoney if you want to keep the non-exempt property.\nChapter 7 is best if:\n1) your income is at or below the median income by\nhousehold size, and\n2) your debts are the kind that are dischargeable in\nbankruptcy.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy gives you a chance to keep your property by completing a court-ordered\nrepayment plan. This plan can take 3 to 5 years. After that time, you get a Discharge Order for your\ndischargeable debts. Your other, non-dischargeable debts are hopefully back on track because of\nyour payments on your payment plan.\nChapter 13 is best if:\n1) your income is too high to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and/or\n2) your debts are a kind that can’t be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nHow does filing for bankruptcy affect my spouse?\nIf you are married and file for bankruptcy, only your debts go away.\nIf the debts are owed by you and your spouse together, the creditor can go after your spouse who\ndidn’t file for bankruptcy. The spouse who didn’t file becomes fully responsible for the debt. This is\ntrue for debts you own with someone else too, not only a spouse.\nSometimes “assets” are sold off to repay creditors. Assets are things you own that have money\nvalue. Your spouse who didn’t file won’t lose their personal assets but if you own something\ntogether, it could be taken away.\nIs it better for married couples to file jointly?\nMarried couples can file for bankruptcy together. This is called a “joint” filing. In a joint bankruptcy,\nboth couples have their names on one bankruptcy application.\nFiling for a joint bankruptcy can be a good thing.\n• It might be cheaper. It means less in filing fees and legal fees.\nC-21 Bankruptcy Basics pg. 3\n\n• You may be able to double your exemptions. Exemptions are things that are protected. The\nfederal exemptions can be doubled for property you own together. In Minnesota, most\ncouples can double all exemptions, except the homestead exemption. This is the amount of\nhome equity that is protected. There may be conditions.\n• Joint debt is discharged, instead of one person becoming responsible for it on their own.\nBut there are downsides of filing for bankruptcy jointly. Some of these are:\n• The bankruptcy affects the credit scores of both of you\n• Both of your non-exempt property is sold off in a chapter 7 bankruptcy\nC-21 Bankruptcy Basics pg. 4"

      "reference_material_content": "The Uniformed And Overseas Citizens\nAbsentee Voting Act\nThe Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) was\nenacted by Congress in 1986. UOCAVA requires that the states and\nterritories allow certain groups of citizens to register and vote absentee in\nelections for Federal offices. In addition, most states and territories have\ntheir own laws allowing citizens covered by UOCAVA to register and vote\nabsentee in state and local elections as well.\nProvisions of UOCAVA\nUnited States citizens covered by UOCAVA include:\n•\nmembers of the United States Uniformed Services and merchant\nmarine;\n•\ntheir family members; and\n•\nUnited States citizens residing outside the United States.\nAmong its key provisions, UOCAVA provides for an application called the\nFederal Post Card Application that qualified servicemembers and\n\noverseas citizens can use to register to vote and request an absentee\nballot simultaneously. The law also allows for the use of a \"back-up\" ballot\nfor federal offices, called the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. This ballot\nmay be cast by voters covered by the Act who have made timely\napplication for, but have not received, their regular ballot from their state\nor territory, subject to certain conditions.\nIn 2009, a subtitle of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal\nYear 2010, titled the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act\n(\"MOVE Act\"), amended UOCAVA to establish new voter registration and\nabsentee ballot procedures which states must follow in all federal\nelections. The amended UOCAVA is available here.\nMost of these new procedures were implemented by the November 2010\ngeneral election. As amended by the MOVE Act, UOCAVA now requires\nstate officials to:\n•\nprovide UOCAVA voters with an option to request and receive voter\nregistration and absentee ballot applications by electronic\ntransmissions and establish electronic transmission options for\ndelivery of blank absentee ballots to UOCAVA voters;\n•\ntransmit validly-requested absentee ballots to UOCAVA voters no later\nthan 45 days before an election for a federal office, when the request\nhas been received by that date, except where an undue hardship\nwaiver is approved by the Department of Defense for that election;\n•\ntake steps to ensure that electronic transmission procedures protect\nthe security of the balloting process and the privacy of the identity and\npersonal data of UOCAVA voters using the procedures;\n•\nexpand the acceptance of the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot to all\nelections for federal office beginning December 31, 2010;\n•\naccept otherwise valid voter registration applications, absentee ballot\napplications, voted ballots, or Federal Write-In Absentee Ballots\nwithout regard to state notarization requirements, or restrictions on\npaper type, or envelope type; and\n•\nallow UOCAVA voters to track the receipt of their absentee ballots\nthrough a free access system.\n\nAdministration of UOCAVA\nThe Secretary of Defense has administrative responsibilities for UOCAVA.\nWithin the Department of Defense, the Secretary has assigned these\nresponsibilities to the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP). The\nFVAP actively monitors the voter registration and absentee voting\nopportunities provided to members of the Armed Forces, their family\nmembers, and U.S. citizens residing overseas. It works closely with the\nStates to assure that citizens covered by UOCAVA have a full opportunity\nto participate in Federal elections.\nThe FVAP maintains a website where you will find detailed information\nabout overseas voting procedures and materials, including instructions for\nobtaining and using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and the\nFederal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). The website also provides\ninformation about using the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho does UOCAVA protect?\nThe protections of UOCAVA apply to: (1) members of the uniformed\nservices on active duty and the merchant marine who, because of their\nmembership in the service, are absent from their place of residence, and\n\nare otherwise qualified to vote; (2) the spouses and dependents of these\nuniformed services voters who are absent due to the member's active duty\nor service and (3) qualified voters who reside outside of the United States.\nWhat rights does UOCAVA give me?\nIf you are a qualified voter protected by UOCAVA, in elections for federal\noffice, the state in which you are qualified to vote must (1) permit you to\nregister to vote and request an absentee ballot if a request is received by\nthe 30th day before the election; (2) send you an absentee ballot early\nenough to receive it, vote it, and send it back, specifically by the 45th day\nbefore the election, if a request is received by that date; (3) permit you to\nrequest and receive your voter registration form, absentee ballot request,\nand blank absentee ballot electronically; (4) permit you to cast a Federal\nWrite-In Absentee Ballot under certain conditions; (5) provide you with\nfree access to a tracking system that tells you whether your ballot has\nbeen received by the appropriate state election official; and (6) accept\notherwise-valid voted ballots even if they are not notarized, and even if\nthey are printed on a nonstandard paper size or sent in a nonstandard type\nenvelope.\nWhat is a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)?\nThe Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) is an official blank write-in\nballot that all UOCAVA voters can use as an emergency “back-up” ballot if\nthey have made a timely request for an absentee ballot from the state or\ncounty but do not receive it in time to send it back by their state's\ndeadline. UOCAVA requires states to accept FWABs in all elections for\nfederal office. If a UOCAVA voter receives a state-issued ballot after\nhaving already sent in a FWAB, the FVAP recommends that the voter vote\nthat ballot and send it in. A state will only count one of the ballots. You can\nfind more information on obtaining and voting a FWAB on the FVAP\nwebsite.\nIf a county is late in mailing absentee ballots to soldiers or U.S. citizens\nliving overseas, what can the Department of Justice do?\n\nUnder Section 105 of UOCAVA, the Attorney General is authorized to bring\ncivil actions to enforce UOCAVA requirements. When states have failed to\nmake sure that ballots are sent to qualified UOCAVA protected voters in a\ntimely manner, the Department of Justice has successfully obtained court\norders and consent decrees. Many of these have required states to extend\ntheir deadlines for receiving these ballots and to count such ballots, even\nwhen they arrived after Election Day. In some cases, the states were\nrequired to make permanent changes to their laws or procedures to make\nsure the problems are not repeated in future elections. Through these\ncases brought to enforce the federal law, the Department has ensured\nthat qualified servicemembers and overseas voters were able to cast their\nballots, and know that they were counted.\nWho can I contact if I have a question about my right to vote?\nThe FVAP administers many of the federal responsibilities under UOCAVA,\nand assists servicemembers, their families and overseas voters to\nfacilitate their participation in the voting process. If you need assistance\nin registering or voting under UOCAVA, you can contact FVAP. If you\nbelieve you have been denied any of the rights guaranteed by UOCAVA,\nyou can contact the Department of Justice."

They stay healthy through a constant process of repair, renewal,\nand mineral release. As we age, the remodeling process can become unbalanced. More old bone gets\nremoved than new bone gets created. Over time, this leaves bones weaker and more likely to break.\nIt’s never too early or too late to improve bone health. Osteoporosis prevention should begin in childhood\nand continue throughout life.\nWHAT IS OSTEOPOROSIS?\nOsteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone,\nor both. As a result, bones become weak and may break from a fall or, in serious cases, from sneezing\nor minor bumps. Approximately 54 million Americans have osteoporosis or low bone mass.2\nBreaking a bone is a serious complication of osteoporosis, especially with older adults. Osteoporotic\nbone breaks are most likely to occur in the hip, spine, or wrist, but other bones can break too. In\naddition to causing permanent pain, osteoporosis causes some people to lose height. When osteoporosis\naffects vertebrae, or the bones of the spine, it often leads to a stooped or hunched posture.\nEAT HEALTHY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN STRONG BONES\nEating a well-balanced diet with plenty of dairy, fish, fruits, and vegetable should provide enough of\nthe nutrients needed to build and maintain strong bones. It’s important to eat a variety of calcium-rich\nfoods every day because it is an essential building block for bones. Vitamin D helps the body absorb\ncalcium, among other things, so it is also important for building and maintaining bone health. Other\nnutrients in a healthy diet also help to maintain bone health throughout the lifespan.\nTHE BONE HEALTH AND\nFEMALES 50 AND YOUNGER 1,000 MG/DAY\nOSTEOPOROSIS FOUNDATION\nFEMALES 51 AND OLDER 1,200 MG/DAY\n(BHOF) RECOMMENDS\nTHE FOLLOWING DAILY\nMALES 70 AND YOUNGER 1,000 MG/DAY\nAMOUNTS OF CALCIUM\nFOR BONE HEALTH MALES 71 AND OLDER 1,200 MG/DAY\n\nCALCIUM RICH FOODS\nIn addition to building bones and keeping them healthy, calcium enables blood to clot, muscles to\ncontract, and the heart to beat. About 99% of the calcium in the human body is in the bones and teeth.\nFortunately, there are many foods that are good sources of calcium (and other healthy nutrients).\nDairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are high in calcium. Certain green vegetables and other\nfoods contain calcium in smaller amounts. Some juices, breakfast foods, soymilk, cereals, snacks, breads,\nand bottled water have added calcium.\nA WELL-BALANCED DIET\nAccording to the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-20253, current low intakes of nutrient-\ndense foods and beverages across food groups has resulted in underconsumption of some nutrients and\ndietary components.

This means that you eat the same amount of CHOs at each meal.\nExamples of healthy CHOs are:\n■ Starches (whole grain bread, brown rice, whole grain pasta)\n■ Beans (lentils, chickpeas)\n■ Starchy vegetables (winter squash, potatoes, corn, peas)\n■ Fruit (apples, grapes, oranges)\n■ Low-fat dairy products (low-fat milk; light, flavored yogurt)\nFoods to limit\nOver time, high blood glucose levels can damage your heart and blood vessels. Some\nfoods can also increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Avoid foods such as:\n■ Foods high in calories\n■ Foods high in saturated fats (high-fat meats, such as beef, hot dogs, deli meats,\nsausage, bacon)\n■ Foods with excess fat from animal products (butter, bacon, mayonnaise, cheese,\ncreamy salad dressings, fried foods)\n■ Foods with trans fats (margarine, bakery foods, processed foods)\n■ Processed foods and added salt (sodium) in your meals\n■ Foods high in sugar:\n- Flavored yogurt\n- Ice cream\n- Juice\n- Dried fruit\n- Syrup-packed canned fruit\n- Fruit spread (jams, jellies)\n- Bakery goods (cookies, cake, pastry)\n- Candy\n- Crackers\n- Sugar-sweetened cereals\n2\n\n- Sweetened drinks (soft drinks, sweetened drink mixes, Kool-Aid®)\n- Sweeteners (sugar, honey, molasses, syrup)\n■ Before choosing to drink alcohol, talk with your physician.\nFood portion choices\nWatch portion sizes:\n■ Large portions of even healthy foods can cause high blood glucose.\n■ Make sure each of your meals has the same amount of CHOs.\n■ Follow the My Plate Planner at myplate.gov.\nUse My Plate Planner\nCreate a healthy plate that will help to keep your blood glucose levels in an acceptable\nrange. Choose foods from the Appendix Food Charts, and follow the plate method’s 4\neasy steps (Figure 1):\n1. Draw a line down the middle of your plate and fill 1/2 of your plate with non-\nstarchy vegetables.\n2. Draw another line across the middle of the other 1/2 of your plate and fill 1/4 of\nyour plate with a grain or starchy vegetable. Fill the last 1/4 of your plate with a\nlean protein.\n3. A small piece of fruit or a serving of dairy is optional.\n4. Finish your meal off with a glass of water or other zero-calorie drink option.\nFigure 1: My Plate Planner\n©2022 Centers for Disease Control (CDC)\n3\n\nReading food labels\nFood labels have important information to help you manage your meal plan (Figure 2).\nSince carbohydrates have a big impact on your blood glucose, it is important to keep\ntrack of how many carbohydrates you eat. Food labels use grams (g) to measure\ncarbohydrates. 1 serving of carbohydrates is 15 grams. Your care team will talk to you\nabout how many grams of carbohydrates per day are right for you.\nFigure 2: Food Nutrition Label\n1. Find the serving size.\n2. Find the calories (amount per serving).\n• Counting calories each day will help\nyou reach your weight loss goal.\n3. Find the total carbohydrate per serving.\n• A dietitian can teach you more about\nthe amount of carbohydrate that fits\nyour specific needs.\n4\n\nA healthy menu example:\nBreakfast Lunch Dinner Snack\n• 1/2 cup oatmeal • 2 slices whole • 3 to 4 ounces baked • 1/3 cup hummus\n• 1 cup berries grain bread fish • 1 cup cucumbers\n• 1 cup skim milk • 3 ounces sliced • 2/3 cup brown rice\n• 1 tbsp peanut turkey • 1 cup cooked broccoli\nbutter • 1 tbsp mustard • 1 cup salad\n• 1 cup carrot sticks • 1 tbsp salad dressing\n• 1 small apple • 1 cup raspberries\nThis menu example shows 3 to 4 servings of carbohydrates at each meal.\nThese are general guidelines.

      "reference_material_content": "넄 Resource library\nCoeliac disease and\ngluten-free diet\nWhat is coeliac disease?\nCoeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. When someone with\ncoeliac disease eats gluten, it causes the body’s immune system to\nattack and damage its own tissues. The tissues that can be damaged\nin this way include the lining of the intestine, particularly the finger-\nlike villi. This often leads to nutrients from food not being absorbed\nproperly.\nCoeliac disease is different from food allergy or intolerance. The only\ntreatment for coeliac disease is a strict, life-long, gluten-free diet.\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. These cereals are\ncommonly used in breads, pasta, breakfast cereals, cakes, biscuits\nand pastries.\n\nWho does coeliac disease affect?\nCoeliac disease is common and affects around one in 100 people. It\ncan develop at any age from babies having their first foods right up to\nthe elderly who may have eaten gluten with no problems for most of\ntheir life. There is a strong genetic aspect, with a 10 per cent chance\nof a first degree relative also having coeliac disease. However, we\ndon’t yet know why some people develop coeliac disease and others\ndon’t. Nearly half a million people in the UK are living with coeliac\ndisease but are not yet diagnosed, which can be harmful to their\nhealth.\nSymptoms of coeliac disease\nBefore treatment is started, people with coeliac disease may have\none or several symptoms with differing levels of severity. Symptoms\nmay include:\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal bloating\ntooth enamel defects\nweight loss\niron-deficiency anaemia\nmouth ulcers\nheadache\nfatigue\n\nSome people with coeliac disease may also suffer from anxiety,\ndepression, constipation, tingling or numbness in hands, feet or\nlimbs, problems with walking or balance, and infertility.\nSome people with coeliac disease do not experience any symptoms\nwhen they eat gluten, although the damage gluten causes may still be\noccurring.\nIn addition, some people may develop a very sore, itchy, red rash that\noften shows up symmetrically on the limbs, back or scalp. This may\nbe a condition called Dermatitis Herpetiformis and can be confirmed\nby a dermatologist. It is treated in the same way with a strict life-long\ngluten-free diet.\nDiagnosis\nIf you think you may have coeliac disease you should visit your GP to\nhave a blood test. It is important to keep gluten in your diet for at\nleast one meal every day for six weeks before the blood test and until\nall tests are complete to ensure it is accurate. Some patients may\nneed two blood tests and some may be referred to have a camera\ntest, called an endoscopy, to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment: a gluten-free diet\nThe only treatment for coeliac disease is a strict, life-long, gluten-free\ndiet. Even very tiny amounts, less than a crumb of bread, can cause\nan immune response and potential damage to the body.\n\nRemoving all traces of gluten can be a daunting task, especially when\nyou are first diagnosed. You will need to find out what foods contain\ngluten and how to ensure that your food is safe.\nA dietitian can help by suggesting suitable foods, taking into account\nyour food preferences. They can also help with reading food labels,\nprovide ideas for avoiding all gluten at home and when out and\nabout, and helping to ensure there is no cross contamination. A\ndietitian will also help you to include all the necessary nutrients such\nas energy, fibre, vitamins and minerals (such as calcium and iron) in\nyour diet.\nLots of foods are naturally gluten free and can still be enjoyed on a\ngluten-free diet, see below:\n\nFood group Naturally gluten-free,\nsome examples\nFruit and All fresh, frozen and canned\nVegetables fruit and vegetables\nStarchy Potatoes, rice, cassava, corn,\nCarbohydrates millet, buckwheat, quinoa,\nteff, gluten-free oats\nDairy foods Milk, cheese, plain or fruit\nand yoghurt (without toppings),\nalternatives soya milk, rice milk or nut\nmilks\nProtein-rich Unprocessed meat, fish,\nfoods beans, pulses, lentils, nuts,\neggs\nGluten is found in wheat, rye and barley, so avoid foods made with\nthese cereal grains. Breads, pasta, breakfast cereals, cakes, biscuits,\nand pastries are usually made with wheat flour and contain\ngluten. These foods can be substituted with gluten-free products\nfound in the free-from sections of the supermarket, including the\n\nfreezer, chiller and bread shelves. These gluten-free foods often cost\nmore. Some people will be able to get gluten-free food on\nprescription from their GP depending on local availability.\nIn the UK, for a food to be labelled ‘gluten free’ it must contain no\nmore than 20 parts per million of gluten. This is the level of gluten\nwhich has been demonstrated to be safe for people with coeliac\ndisease. Codex wheat starch (sometimes referred to as ‘gluten-free\nwheat starch’) is found in some gluten-free products. The gluten has\nbeen removed from this ingredient, so the product containing it is\nstill safe to eat, if labelled as ‘gluten free’. Similarly, some products\nmay contain barley malt extract - provided the product is labelled\n‘gluten free’, it is also safe to eat.\nThe charity Coeliac UK has many helpful resources and apps to help\nyou identify which foods are suitable to eat in all sections of the\nsupermarket. The picture of Coeliac UK’s Crossed Grain symbol is\nalso useful as a trusted sign that a packaged food is gluten free.\nCrossed Grain certified products have been through extra checks\nincluding gluten analysis certificates and independent audits of how\nthey are manufactured to ensure people with coeliac disease can be\nconfident these products are suitable for a gluten-free diet.\nWhat is cross contamination?\nCross contamination occurs when gluten-free food comes into\ncontact with gluten. For example, when sharing a toaster, crumbs\nfrom gluten-containing bread can touch and contaminate your\ngluten-free toast, making it unsafe to eat.\nOats are often contaminated with wheat, rye and barley during\ngrowing, harvesting and production. If you have coeliac disease it is\nessential you only eat oats that are labelled as gluten-free. A small\n\nproportion of people may be sensitive to oats and have symptoms\nwhen eating gluten-free oats. Discuss this with your dietitian if you\nthink this is the case.\nTop tips\nGluten-free bread sometimes tastes better baked or toasted; try\nseveral products as they do differ. Companies may give a\nsample pack for newly diagnosed patients to try.\nUse a separate margarine, nut butter or jam to reduce risk of\ncross contamination.\nTry using a toaster pocket if you’re using a toaster that is also\nused to toast gluten-containing bread.\nTry to go for naturally gluten-free foods to reduce the impact of\nthe higher cost of gluten-free products.\nTake snacks or a packed lunch if you are not sure if there will be\ngluten-free options when you are away from home.\nLook for gluten-free nights at fish and chip restaurants – this is\noften when they change the cooking oil to prevent cross\ncontamination.\nFor eating out, call ahead and ask questions about how your\nfood will be prepared. This will help you identify if your meal is\ntruly gluten free.\nFor eating out, look out for the Coeliac UK GF accreditation - this\nmeans Coeliac UK have audited the venue's processes to ensure\nthey meet the required standard to offer safe gluten-free food\nand ensures the staff have been trained to understand coeliac\ndisease and the requirements of the gluten-free diet.\nDiscuss your diagnosis with friends and family (or your child’s\nschool if your child is affected) so they can support a gluten-free\n\ndiet.\nJoin supportive groups such as coeliac local support groups in\nyour area, coeliac groups online or via social media to get\nsupport and more information on travelling, or recipe ideas."

      "reference_material_content": "An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nNational Institutes of Health\nMassage Therapy: What You Need\nTo Know\nWhat is massage therapy used for?\nMassage therapy is used to help manage a health condition or\nenhance wellness. It involves manipulating the soft tissues of the body.\nMassage has been practiced in most cultures, both Eastern and\nWestern, throughout human history, and was one of the earliest tools\nthat people used to try to relieve pain.\nWhat are the different types of massage?\nThe term “massage therapy” includes many techniques. The most\ncommon form of massage therapy in Western countries is called\nSwedish or classical massage; it is the core of most massage training\nprograms. Other styles include sports massage, clinical massage to\naccomplish specific goals such as releasing muscle spasms, and\nmassage traditions derived from Eastern cultures, such as Shiatsu and\nTuina.\nHow popular is massage therapy?\nNational survey data show that 10.9 percent of U.S. adults used\nmassage therapy in 2022, more than double the percentage who used\nit in 2002 (4.8 percent).\nDo massages help pain?\nMassage therapy has been studied for several types of pain, including\nlow-back pain, neck and shoulder pain, pain from osteoarthritis of the\nknee, and headaches. Here’s what the science says:\nLow-Back Pain\nSeveral evaluations of massage for low-back pain have found only\nweak evidence that it may be helpful.\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in a 2016\nevaluation of nondrug therapies for low-back pain, examined 20\nstudies that compared massage to usual care or other\ninterventions and found that there was evidence that massage\nwas helpful for chronic low-back pain but the strength of the\nevidence was low. The agency also looked at six studies that\ncompared different types of massage but found that the evidence\nwas insufficient to show whether any types were more effective\nthan others.\nA 2015 review of 25 studies with a total of 3,096 participants\nfound that in both acute and chronic low-back pain, there were\nshort-term improvements in pain after massage therapy. However,\nbecause the quality of the studies was low, the investigators who\nconducted the review concluded that they had “very little\nconfidence” that massage is an effective treatment for low-back\npain.\nClinical practice guidelines (guidance for health care providers)\nissued by the American College of Physicians in 2017 included\nmassage therapy as an option for treating acute/subacute low-\nback pain but did not include massage therapy among the\noptions for treating chronic low-back pain.\nNeck and Shoulder Pain\nMassage therapy may be helpful for neck or shoulder pain, but the\nbenefits may only last for a short time.\nA 2013 review of 12 studies (757 total participants) found that\nmassage therapy was more helpful for both neck and shoulder\npain than inactive therapies but was not more effective than other\nactive therapies. For shoulder pain, massage therapy had short-\nterm benefits only.\nA 2016 review of 4 studies conducted in the United States (519\nparticipants) found that massage could provide short-term relief of\nneck pain if massage sessions were long enough and frequent\nenough.\nOsteoarthritis of the Knee\nThe small amount of research that’s been done on massage therapy\nfor osteoarthritis of the knee suggests that it may have short-term\nbenefits in relieving knee pain.\n\nOf 6 studies that evaluated massage therapy for osteoarthritis of\nthe knee (408 total participants), 5 found that it provided short-\nterm pain relief. Two of the studies that showed pain relief (149\nparticipants) involved the use of essential oils (aromatherapy\nmassage).\nFor more information, see NCCIH’s fact sheet on osteoarthritis.\nHeadaches\nOnly a small number of studies of massage for headache have been\ncompleted. These studies looked at different types of massage and\ndifferent types of headache, and their results are not consistent.\nA 2016 study with 64 participants evaluated 2 types of massage\n(lymphatic drainage and traditional massage), once a week for 8\nweeks, in patients with migraine. The frequency of migraines\ndecreased in both groups, compared with people on a waiting list.\nIn a 2015 study, 56 people with tension headaches were assigned\nto receive massage at myofascial trigger points or an inactive\ntreatment (detuned ultrasound) twice a week for 6 weeks or to be\non a waiting list. People who received either massage or the\ninactive treatment had a decrease in the frequency of headaches,\nbut there was no difference between the two groups.\nA 2011 study evaluated the effect of adding hand massage to\nmultimodal behavior treatment of migraine in 83 people. Hand\nmassage had no effect on migraine frequency.\nFor more information, see NCCIH’s fact sheet on headaches.\nCan massage help cancer patients?\nWith appropriate precautions, massage therapy can be part of\nsupportive care for cancer patients who would like to try it; however,\nthe evidence that it can relieve pain and anxiety is not strong.\nMassage therapy, with or without aromatherapy (the use of\nessential oils) has been used to attempt to relieve pain, anxiety,\nand other symptoms in people with cancer. A 2016 evaluation of\n19 studies (more than 1,200 participants) of massage for cancer\npatients found some evidence that massage might help with pain\nand anxiety, but the quality of the evidence was very low (because\nmost studies were small and some may have been biased), and\nfindings were not consistent.\n\nClinical practice guidelines (guidance for health care providers) for\nthe care of breast cancer patients include massage as one of\nseveral approaches that may be helpful for stress reduction,\nanxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life. Clinical practice\nguidelines for the care of lung cancer patients suggest that\nmassage therapy could be added as part of supportive care in\npatients whose anxiety or pain is not adequately controlled by\nusual care.\nMassage therapists may need to modify their usual techniques\nwhen working with cancer patients; for example, they may have to\nuse less pressure than usual in areas that are sensitive because of\ncancer or cancer treatments.\nFor more information, see NCCIH’s fact sheet on cancer.\nCan massage be helpful for fibromyalgia\nsymptoms?\nMassage therapy may be helpful for some fibromyalgia symptoms if\nit’s continued for long enough.\nA 2014 evaluation of 9 studies (404 total participants) concluded\nthat massage therapy, if continued for at least 5 weeks, improved\npain, anxiety, and depression in people with fibromyalgia but did\nnot have an effect on sleep disturbance.\nA 2015 evaluation of 10 studies (478 total participants) compared\nthe effects of different kinds of massage therapy and found that\nmost styles of massage had beneficial effects on quality of life in\npeople with fibromyalgia. Swedish massage may be an exception;\n2 studies of this type of massage (56 total participants) did not\nshow benefits.\nFor more information, see NCCIH’s fact sheet on fibromyalgia.\nCan massage therapy be helpful for\npeople with HIV/AIDS?\nThere’s some evidence that massage therapy may have benefits for\nanxiety, depression, and quality of life in people with HIV/AIDS, but the\namount of research and number of people studied are small.\nMassage therapy may help improve the quality of life for people\nwith HIV or AIDS, a 2010 review of 4 studies with a total of 178\nparticipants concluded."

      "reference_material_content": "An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nNational Institutes of Health\nRelaxation Techniques: What You\nNeed To Know\nWhat are relaxation techniques?\nRelaxation techniques are practices to help bring about the body’s\n“relaxation response,” which is characterized by slower breathing,\nlower blood pressure, and a reduced heart rate. The relaxation\nresponse is the opposite of the stress response.\nSome of the studies discussed in this fact sheet compare relaxation\ntechniques to cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral ©Thinkstock\ntherapy is a type of psychological treatment that helps a person\nbecome aware of ways of thinking that may be automatic but are\ninaccurate and harmful. The therapy involves efforts to change\nthinking patterns and usually behavioral patterns as well.\nWhat are the different types of relaxation\ntechniques?\nListed below are some of the different types of relaxation techniques.\nProgressive Relaxation: Also called progressive muscle\nrelaxation, this technique involves tensing different muscles in\nyour body and then releasing the tension.\nAutogenic Training: Through a series of mental exercises\ninvolving relaxation and ideas you suggest to yourself\n(autosuggestion), your mind focuses on your body’s experience of\nrelaxation.\nGuided Imagery or “Visualization”: In guided imagery, you\npicture objects, scenes, or events that are associated with\nrelaxation or calmness and attempt to produce a similar feeling in\nyour body.\n\nBiofeedback-Assisted Relaxation: Through feedback that is\nusually provided by an electronic device, you learn how to\nrecognize and manage how your body responds. The electronic\ndevice lets you see how your heart rate, blood pressure, or\nmuscle tension changes in response to feeling stressed or\nrelaxed.\nSelf-Hypnosis: In self-hypnosis programs, people learn to\nproduce the relaxation response when prompted by a phrase or\nnonverbal cue (called a “suggestion”) of their own.\nBreathing Exercises: For breathing exercises, you might focus\non taking slow, deep breaths—also called diaphragmatic\nbreathing.\nOther complementary health practices such as massage therapy,\nmeditation, yoga, tai chi, and qigong can produce several beneficial\neffects in the body, including the relaxation response; however, these\npractices are not discussed in this fact sheet. For more detailed\ninformation on these practices, see “Massage Therapy: What You\nNeed To Know,” “Meditation,” “Yoga: What You Need To Know,” “Tai\nChi: In Depth,” and “Qigong: What You Need To Know.”\nHow popular are relaxation techniques?\nThe National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative U.S.\nsurvey, found that 6.4 percent of U.S. adults used guided imagery\nand/or progressive muscle relaxation in 2022; in 2002, only 3.8 percent\nused these techniques.\nCan relaxation techniques help during\nlabor and childbirth?\nMany women would like to use nondrug options for pain relief during\nlabor and childbirth.\nA 2018 review included 5 studies (total of 1,248 participants) that\nused various relaxation techniques and measured women’s pain\nintensity during labor. Overall, the studies found that relaxation\ntechniques might help women manage labor pain, but the quality\nof the research varied between low and very low. Also, because\ndifferent relaxation techniques were used, it’s hard to say which\nspecific techniques might help.\n\nA 2019 review compared women’s views and experiences of\nusing pain medicine (epidurals, opioids) and nondrug methods\n(relaxation, massage) for pain relief options during labor and\nchildbirth. Eight studies (99 women) looked at relaxation. The\noverall findings showed mixed experiences for both methods of\npain relief. Some women who used the nondrug methods\nreported that they were less effective than anticipated.\nCan children and adolescents benefit\nfrom relaxation techniques?\nSome relaxation techniques may help children and adolescents with\npain, anxiety and depression, headaches, or difficulty with needle-\nrelated procedures. But much of the supporting research was rated as\nlow quality, so we don’t have a completely clear picture yet of the\npossible benefits.\nPain\nA 2017 review on recurrent abdominal pain in children and\nadolescents found that guided imagery and hypnotherapy may\nbe helpful in reducing pain in the short term, but the quality of the\nresearch was low. The review included 2 small studies on guided\nimagery and 2 small studies on practitioner-led hypnotherapy\n(plus homework), with a total of 146 participants.\nA 2019 review of 10 studies with 697 participants looked at the\neffect that remotely delivered psychological therapies had on\nchronic pain in children and adolescents. Nine of the studies\nincluded a relaxation component in the treatment. “Remotely\ndelivered” meant flexible, self-guided treatments that were\ntypically internet-based and didn’t usually involve contact with a\nclinician. The review found that psychological therapies delivered\nremotely were helpful at reducing headache pain right after\ntreatment but not later at follow up. No benefit was found for the\nother types of pain that were studied. Overall, the research was\nconsidered to be of very low quality.\n\nHeadache\nA 2019 review of 7 studies involving 571 children looked at the\neffects of relaxation training on migraine headaches, tension-\ntype headache, or both. Although some studies reported\ndecreased headache frequency, duration, and intensity after\nrelaxation training, other studies did not. Overall, the results were\ninconsistent, and the research was of very low quality.\nA 2016 review of 5 studies involving 137 children and adolescents\nfound that biofeedback seemed to be helpful with migraines,\nespecially with reducing their frequency. The number of\nparticipants in the studies, however, was small.\nA 2019 review indicated that self-relaxation, biofeedback, and\nself-hypnosis may be reasonable alternatives to using medicine\nin managing childhood migraine, particularly in adolescents.\nAccording to this review, however, some of the best evidence\nseen in any pediatric migraine therapy study has been for\ncognitive behavioral therapy added to treatment with standard\nantimigraine medicines.\nCan relaxation techniques lower blood\npressure?\nHigh blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, such as\nheart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. Having a healthy\nlifestyle can help to prevent high blood pressure. One part of a healthy\nlifestyle is learning how to relax and manage stress.\n\nA 2019 review of 17 studies involving 1,165 participants indicated\nthat slow breathing exercises led to a modest reduction in blood\npressure and may be a reasonable first treatment for people with\nprehypertension or low-risk high blood pressure. The studies in\nthis review, however, differed in how they were done and had\nshort follow-up periods and high risk of bias. Also, the studies\ndidn’t look at whether slow breathing exercises ultimately\ninfluenced health outcomes, such as stroke or heart attack.\nA 2018 review found that relaxation therapies and biofeedback\nmight be helpful for reducing blood pressure, but only weak\nrecommendations were made for their use because the quality of\ndata from the 29 studies ranged from low to very low.\nIf you have high blood pressure, it’s important to follow the\ntreatment plan prescribed by your health care provider. Following\nyour treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay\nserious complications of high blood pressure. If you’re\nconsidering a complementary or integrative approach for your\nhigh blood pressure, discuss it with your health care provider."

See\nhow you can easily learn to practice\nmeditation whenever you need it most.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nDec. 14, 2023\nIf stress has you anxious, tense and worried, you\nmight try meditation. Spending even a few minutes\nin meditation can help restore your calm and inner\npeace.\nAnyone can practice meditation. It's simple and\nk\nc\na\ndoesn't cost much. And you don't need any special b\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nequipment.\nYou can practice meditation wherever you are. You\ncan meditate when you're out for a walk, riding the\nbus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the\nmiddle of a business meeting.\nUnderstanding meditation\nMeditation has been around for thousands of years.\nEarly meditation was meant to help deepen\nunderstanding of the sacred and mystical forces of\nlife. These days, meditation is most often used to\nrelax and lower stress.\nMeditation is a type of mind-body complementary\nmedicine. Meditation can help you relax deeply and\ncalm your mind.\nDuring meditation, you focus on one thing. You get\nrid of the stream of thoughts that may be crowding\nyour mind and causing stress. This process can lead\nto better physical and emotional well-being.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nTypes of meditation\nMeditation is an umbrella term for the many ways to\nget to a relaxed state. There are many types of\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\nmeditation and ways to relax that use parts of e\ne\nF\n\nmeditation. All share the same goal of gaining inner\npeace.\nWays to meditate can include:\nGuided meditation. This is sometimes called\nguided imagery or visualization. With this\nmethod of meditation, you form mental images\nof places or things that help you relax.\nYou try to use as many senses as you can.\nThese include things you can smell, see, hear\nand feel. You may be led through this process\nby a guide or teacher.\nMantra meditation. In this type of meditation,\nyou repeat a calming word, thought or phrase\nto keep out unwanted thoughts.\nMindfulness meditation.This type of\nmeditation is based on being mindful. This\nmeans being more aware of the present.\nIn mindfulness meditation, you focus on one\nthing, such as the flow of your breath. You can\nnotice your thoughts and feelings. But let them\npass without judging them.\nQigong. This practice most often combines k\nc\na\nb\nd\nmeditation, relaxation, movement and e\ne\nF\n\nbreathing exercises to restore and maintain\nbalance. Qigong (CHEE-gung) is part of Chinese\nmedicine.\nTai chi. This is a form of gentle Chinese martial\narts training. In tai chi (TIE-CHEE), you do a\nseries of postures or movements in a slow,\ngraceful way. And you do deep breathing with\nthe movements.\nYoga. You do a series of postures with\ncontrolled breathing. This helps give you a more\nflexible body and a calm mind. To do the poses,\nyou need to balance and focus. That helps you\nto focus less on your busy day and more on the\nmoment.\nParts of meditation\nEach type of meditation may include certain\nfeatures to help you meditate. These may vary\ndepending on whose guidance you follow or who's\nteaching a class. Some of the most common\nfeatures in meditation include:\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nFocused attention. Focusing your attention is\none of the most important elements of\nmeditation.\nFocusing your attention is what helps free your\nmind from the many things that cause stress\nand worry. You can focus your attention on\nthings such as a certain object, an image, a\nmantra or even your breathing.\nRelaxed breathing. This technique involves\ndeep, even-paced breathing using the muscle\nbetween your chest and your belly, called the\ndiaphragm muscle, to expand your lungs. The\npurpose is to slow your breathing, take in more\noxygen, and reduce the use of shoulder, neck\nand upper chest muscles while breathing so\nthat you breathe better.\nA quiet setting. If you're a beginner, meditation\nmay be easier if you're in a quiet spot. Aim to\nhave fewer things that can distract you,\nincluding no television, computers or\ncellphones.\nAs you get more skilled at meditation, you may\nk\nbe able to do it anywhere. This includes high- c\na\nb\nd\ne\nstress places, such as a traffic jam, a stressfuel\nF\n\nwork meeting or a long line at the grocery store.\nThis is when you can get the most out of\nmeditation.\nA comfortable position. You can practice\nmeditation whether you're sitting, lying down,\nwalking, or in other positions or activities. Just\ntry to be comfortable so that you can get the\nmost out of your meditation. Aim to keep good\nposture during meditation.\nOpen attitude. Let thoughts pass through your\nmind without judging them.\nEveryday ways to practice\nmeditation\nDon't let the thought of meditating the \"right\" way\nadd to your stress. If you choose to, you can attend\nspecial meditation centers or group classes led by\ntrained instructors. But you also can practice\nmeditation easily on your own. There are apps to use\ntoo.\nAnd you can make meditation as formal or informal\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\nas you like. Some people build meditation into theeir\ne\nF\n\ndaily routine. For example, they may start and end\neach day with an hour of meditation. But all you\nreally need is a few minutes a day for meditation.\nHere are some ways you can practice meditation on\nyour own, whenever you choose:\nBreathe deeply. This is good for beginners\nbecause breathing is a natural function.\nFocus all your attention on your breathing. Feel\nyour breath and listen to it as you inhale and\nexhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply\nand slowly. When your mind wanders, gently\nreturn your focus to your breathing.\nScan your body. When using this technique,\nfocus attention on each part of your body.\nBecome aware of how your body feels. That\nmight be pain, tension, warmth or relaxation.\nMix body scanning with breathing exercises\nand think about breathing heat or relaxation\ninto and out of the parts of your body.\nRepeat a mantra. You can create your own\nmantra. It can be religious or not. Examples of\nreligious mantras include the Jesus Prayer in k\nc\na\nb\nd\nthe Christian tradition, the holy name of God ein\ne\nF\n\nJudaism, or the om mantra of Hinduism,\nBuddhism and other Eastern religions.\nWalk and meditate. Meditating while walking is\na good and healthy way to relax. You can use\nthis technique anywhere you're walking, such\nas in a forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall.\nWhen you use this method, slow your walking\npace so that you can focus on each movement\nof your legs or feet. Don't focus on where you're\ngoing. Focus on your legs and feet. Repeat\naction words in your mind such as \"lifting,\"\n\"moving\" and \"placing\" as you lift each foot,\nmove your leg forward and place your foot on\nthe ground. Focus on the sights, sounds and\nsmells around you.\nPray. Prayer is the best known and most widely\nused type of meditation. Spoken and written\nprayers are found in most faith traditions.\nYou can pray using your own words or read\nprayers written by others. Check the self-help\nsection of your local bookstore for examples.\nTalk with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other\nk\nspiritual leader about possible resources. c\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nRead and reflect. Many people report that they\nbenefit from reading poems or sacred texts and\ntaking a few moments to think about their\nmeaning.\nYou also can listen to sacred music, spoken\nwords, or any music that relaxes or inspires you.\nYou may want to write your thoughts in a\njournal or discuss them with a friend or spiritual\nleader.\nFocus your love and kindness. In this type of\nmeditation, you think of others with feelings of\nlove, compassion and kindness. This can help\nincrease how connected you feel to others.\nk\nF"

This ancient Chinese practice is a\npopular way to calm your mind and energize your\nbody that requires no special training or equipment.\nAnd — while it’s far from conclusive — some research\nsuggests the practice is good for your health.\nIntegrative medicine specialist Yufang Lin, MD,\nexplains what qigong is and how to add it into your\nwellness routine.\n\nWhat is qigong?\nQigong is a 4,000-year-old traditional Chinese\nmedicine (TCM) practice that blends intentional\nmovement, meditation and breathing practices. It’s\nbased on the theoretical principle that we all have qi\n(pronounced “chi”), an energetic life force, flowing\nthrough our bodies. The belief is that qigong reduces\nstagnation of that energy, allowing the body to better\nheal itself. The literal translation of qigong is “to work\nwith qi.”\n“According to TCM, your qi must flow throughout\nyour body for you to feel your best,” Dr. Lin explains.\n“If qi becomes blocked or stuck in a certain area,\nhealth problems can occur.”\nLike most practices that have been around for\nthousands of years, there isn’t one way to do qigong.\nThere are hundreds of different traditions, schools\nand approaches.\n\nThe most popular variant of qigong in the Western\nworld is tai chi, which is commonly practiced in\nmedical and wellness settings. Its focus on\nintentional movement, breath control and meditation\nhas documented health benefits. Current science\ndoesn’t support health claims associated with other,\nmore spiritual forms of qigong.\nHealth benefits of qigong\nAccording to Dr. Lin, small studies have shown that\nqigong provides a wide variety of health benefits. But\nthat research also has limitations. Some problems,\nlike small sample sizes, could be corrected by larger,\nmore robust studies. Other issues — like the fact that\nthere are hundreds of different types of qigong — are\nharder to address.\nThe existing evidence isn’t strong enough to support\nusing qigong to treat or prevent health problems. But\n\nit does suggest qigong is safe to try and could be a\nhelpful supportive therapy.\nHere’s what the research says about qigong.\nQigong and chronic illness\nAccording to early studies, qigong may be a helpful\ncomplement to standard medical treatments for a\nwide range of conditions, including:\nArthritis\nDepression and anxiety\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nFibromyalgia\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nParkinson’s disease\nQigong and sleep\n\nSleep comes up in lots of studies about qigong and\nchronic illness. A 2024 review looked at those\nresults. Despite the flaws in the studies they\nexamined, the researchers found the “predominantly\npositive outcomes” interesting.\nTheir conclusion? While more, better studies are\nneeded, the existing literature suggests qigong may\nhelp people dealing with sleep issues.\nQigong and fall prevention\nLike other types of intentional movement, qigong has\nbeen found to improve balance and gait, which\nreduces your risk of falling.\n“As a child who grew up in Taiwan, I would see\npeople practicing qigong in the park on my way to\nschool,” Dr. Lin recalls. “Many were elderly. The slow,\npurposeful movements of qigong are less\nchallenging to your balance. But they still enhance\nmobility, coordination and spatial awareness.”\n\nQigong and brain function\nA 2023 review of qigong studies found that the\npractice changes the hippocampus and prefrontal\ncortex of your brain in ways that may support\nmemory, spatial awareness, focus and information\nprocessing.\nHow to do qigong\nIf you’re considering taking a class, ask the\ninstructor:\nWhat type of qigong they teach (examples\ninclude Eight Pieces of Brocade, Swimming\nDragon and Five Animals)\nHow long they’ve been practicing\nWhat, if any, certifications they hold\nWho usually takes their classes\nWhether they have experience accommodating\nyour specific health concerns\n\nThere is no licensing requirement for qigong\ninstructors, but there are professional organizations,\nlike the National Qigong Association, that offer\ncertification programs. Those websites can be a\ngreat place to learn about courses in your area.\nNot finding a group near you? That’s OK! While taking\na class is helpful, Dr. Lin says it isn’t necessary. Many\npeople learn qigong from free online videos.\n“These movements are easy for most people to do,\nand you can modify them if you need to,” she\nexplains. “Pay attention to the form and learn it\nproperly first. Then, you can focus on breathing and\nbeing present.”\nDr. Lin’s other recommendation? Talk to your provider\nbefore starting qigong — or any other intentional\nmovement practice, for that matter. Your healthcare\nteam can help you figure out what safe participation\nlooks like for you. You can even do chair-based\nqigong if you can’t stand.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe science on the health benefits of qigong is\ngrowing, although more studies are needed. And Dr.\nLin is crystal clear: Qigong isn’t a substitute for\nmedical treatment.\nBut she also points out that it’s popular for a reason:\nPeople enjoy it! And it makes them feel good! So,\ngive it a try. If it makes you happy, that’s more than\nenough reason to keep it up.\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nHealth Library"

      "reference_material_content": "Consumer\nAlert\nKnow Your Rights as a California Tenant\nEvictions\nAs a tenant, knowing your rights is critical. You may be protected from certain types of evictions, and you may be\nable to prevent an eviction by fixing the issue identified in an eviction notice. The key is to act quickly—do not ignore\nnotices or court papers, and seek legal help as soon as possible. Evictions can move fast, and you could lose a court\ncase automatically if you take too long to act.\n• You can only be evicted by a court order. It is illegal for a landlord to lock you out, shut off your utilities, or\nremove your things to force you out. Only a Sheriff, a Marshal, or their deputies may evict you, and only with\na court order. Your landlord can only get a court order by starting an eviction case (also called an “unlawful\ndetainer”).\n• Your landlord must first give you a written eviction notice. Before your landlord can start an eviction case\nagainst you, they must give you a written notice stating why they want to evict you and how much time you have\nto do what they ask or move out. Your landlord cannot start an eviction case until the deadline in the notice has\npassed. The notice must be either (1) given to you in person; (2) given to another adult in your home and mailed\nto you; or (3) posted on your home and mailed to you. Just an email or text message, or verbal notice, is not\nenough.\n• Read the notice carefully. Some notices give you an opportunity to pay money owed or to fix a problem. These\nare called “pay or quit” or “perform or quit” notices because they give you the option of fixing the problem or\n“quitting” (meaning, moving out) before a deadline. Other notices only give you a deadline to move out. If you\ndon’t move out or fix the problem before the deadline, your landlord can start an eviction case, meaning they\ncan ask a judge to order you to move out and possibly pay your landlord money. Here are some common types\nof notices:\nTitle of Notice What it Means\n3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit Pay rent or move out within 3 days\n3-Day Notice to Perform (or Cure) or Quit Fix a problem or move out within 3 days\nMove out within 3 days due to a serious lease\n3-Day Notice to Quit\nviolation that the landlord claims cannot be fixed\nMove out because your lease term has expired or for\n30-Day or 60-Day Notice to Quit\na valid “no fault” reason\n• Try to fix the issue in the eviction notice before the deadline. If you do what the landlord says by the deadline,\nyour landlord should not be able to get a court order evicting you. Get legal help if you have questions about a\nnotice or if there’s something wrong with the notice.\no If the notice asks you to pay rent or fix a problem within a certain number of days:\n Calculate the deadline by counting the number of business days. Start from the day after the no-\ntice was given to you and skip any Saturdays, Sundays, or court holidays.1 For example, if a 3-day\nNotice to Pay is delivered on the Friday before a non-holiday weekend, the deadline is the following\nWednesday.\n If you can pay the amount or fix the issue, be sure to tell your landlord in writing (a letter, email, or\ntext message) when you have done so. Keep copies of that writing and of proof that you paid or fixed\nthe issue, such as photographs and receipts.\no If the notice tells you that you must move out within a certain number of days:\n Count every day starting with the day after the notice was given to you. Do not skip any days.\n If the last day that you count (e.g., the 3rd or 30th day) is a Saturday, Sunday, or a court holiday,2 then\nthe deadline is the next business day.\n1 www.courts.ca.gov/holidays.htm\n2 www.courts.ca.gov/holidays.htm\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\no Even if you don’t move out by the deadline, your landlord cannot force you out—they must start an eviction\ncase in court.\n• Notify your landlord in writing if you decide to move out before being evicted. Always keep copies of any notices\nor letters you send to your landlord, and return your keys before leaving. This can help protect your credit record\nand prevent a court from ordering you to pay your landlord money.\n• Act immediately if you get eviction-related court documents. To start an eviction case, your landlord has to serve\nyou with court documents called a “Summons” and a “Complaint.” If you receive any court document related to an\neviction, get legal help right away.\no Once your landlord serves you with court documents, you will have only 5 business days to file a response in\ncourt.\no If you fail to file a response in court within 5 business days, your landlord may win automatically by getting a\ndefault judgment against you.\no If you do respond, your landlord (or you) can ask for a trial. The court will mail you a letter with your court\ndate. If you don’t hear about a court date after a week, call or visit the court clerk’s office to see if a court\ndate has been scheduled.\no For more information about eviction trials, visit the California Courts’ webpage on eviction trials.3\no If your landlord wins their eviction case, the court can order you to pay the landlord money and a Sheriff or\nMarshal can make you move out after posting a notice on your door. The fact you were evicted can be on\nyour credit record for 7 years.\n• You may have defenses against eviction under state, federal, or local laws. Certain types of evictions and high rent\nincreases are illegal statewide. For example, for most tenants, a landlord must have a valid reason, also known as\n“just cause,” to evict a tenant who has lived in a rental for more than a year. Your local government may provide\nadditional eviction and rent-increase protections. There are also laws protecting you from discrimination and\nretaliation. To learn more about your rights as a tenant, visit our Landlord-Tenant webpage.4 The California Courts\nwebpage5 has self-help information about evictions, rent control, security deposits and legal service programs\nthat are available to help you. The California Civil Rights Department6 has helpful information about housing\ndiscrimination, reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities, and landlord harassment. The California\nDepartment of Housing and Community Development7 has information about evictions and other issues faced by\nmobilehome park residents. Your city or county may also have laws that prevent certain types of evictions, limit\nrent increases, and prevent landlord harassment.\nGet legal help as soon as possible to learn about your options.

      "reference_material_content": "Consumer\nAlert\nKnow Your Rights as a California Tenant\nSecurity Deposits\nCalifornia has strict rules about tenant security deposits that all residential landlords and property managers must\nfollow. (Civ. Code, § 1950.5.) Knowing the rules can help tenants protect their hard-earned money.\n• Security deposits are refundable. A security deposit belongs to the tenant, but the landlord is allowed to hold\non to it until the tenant moves out. If a landlord sells the property, the landlord must either return the deposit or\ngive it to the new owner to hold on to. By law, security deposits must be returned when the tenant moves out,\nminus allowed expenses.\n• The law limits the amount of security deposits.\nUntil July 1, 2024, the limit is two times the monthly rent (or, for furnished units, three times the\no\nrent).\nAfter July 1, 2024, the limit is one month’s rent. For landlords who own no more than two residential\no\nrental properties that collectively include no more than four total units for rent, the limit is two times\nthe monthly rent, but only if the landlord is a natural person or a limited liability company in which\nall members are natural persons.\n• Landlords can only use security deposits for the following specified expenses:\nPast-due rent.\no\nThe cost of repairing damages caused by tenants or their guests, not including ordinary wear and\no\ntear.\nThe cost of cleaning the property so that it is as clean as when the tenant first moved in.\no\nThe cost of replacing or restoring the landlord’s personal property, such as furniture, but only if the\no\nrental agreement says this is allowed.\n• Security deposits MAY NOT be used for other costs, such as (1) damages that were already there when the\ntenant moved in; (2) unreasonable or unnecessary expenses; or (3) ordinary wear and tear.\n• Take advantage of the right to an inspection before move-out. After learning that a tenant plans to move,\nlandlords must notify tenants of the right to ask for an initial inspection so that the tenant has a chance to fix any\nissues and avoid charges. If the tenant asks for an inspection, it must happen within the two weeks before the\ntenant moves out.\nThe tenant has the right to be there during the inspection.\no\nThe landlord must identify the damages the landlord intends to deduct from the security deposit and\no\ngive the tenant an itemized statement so that the tenant has a chance to fix the problems before\ngetting charged.\n• Within 21 days after move-out, the landlord must send the tenant an itemized statement explaining in detail any\ndeductions from the security deposit (unless they total less than $125), and return the rest of the deposit.\nIf the landlord did the repairs, the statement must show the work done, the time spent, and the\no\nhourly rate.\nIf someone else did the work, the landlord must provide a copy of the bill for the work.\no\nIf the work cannot be finished in 21 days, the statement must give a good faith cost estimate. The\no\nlandlord must then provide the final statement and return the remaining deposit within 14 days of\nfinishing work.\n• Check local city or county rules, which may have more tenant protections or landlord requirements. For\nexample, some cities make landlords pay interest on security deposits.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\n• Additional protections apply to service members. If you are a service member, you may be entitled to lower\nsecurity deposits and certain eviction protections. Ask your base legal office for help. For the legal office’s contact\ninformation, ask your command or visit legalassistance.law.af.mil.\n• Landlords can face penalties for breaking the security deposit laws.\nIf a tenant files a court case claiming the security deposit laws were violated, the landlord has to\no\nprove that the amounts deducted were reasonable. If the landlord acted in bad faith, courts can\naward the tenant his or her actual loss plus up to twice the amount of the deposit.\nGet help from a lawyer!

Depending on where you live, this\ncap may be even lower. See the chart on the next page for the statewide cap that applies where you live.\nWhen raising your rent, your landlord must provide formal written notice — a call, text, or email is not\nenough — at least 30 days before the increase can take effect. If the rent is more than 10%, your landlord\nmust provide notice at least 90 days before the increase can take effect.\nYou can only be evicted by court order. It is illegal for a landlord to lock you out, shut off your utilities,\nor put your things out on the curb to try to force you out. If you get an eviction notice, get legal help\nright away. If your landlord files for eviction in court and you fail to respond, the court may order eviction\nwithout waiting for you.\nYou can generally only be evicted for “just cause.” This does not apply if you lived somewhere for less than\na year or to some types of housing, such as housing built in the last 15 years. (Civil Code § 1946.2.) Just\ncause includes:\n• Not paying rent\n• Breaking a material term of your lease\n• Committing nuisance or waste, or using the premises for unlawful purposes\n• Engaging in criminal activity on the premises or directed at your landlord\n• Refusing to allow lawful entry to the premises\n• Refusing to sign a new lease that contains similar terms to your existing lease\n• The owner is withdrawing the unit from the rental market, moving into the unit, demolishing or\nsubstantially remodeling the unit, or complying with a law or order that requires you to leave.\nYour landlord must repair health and safety issues. For example, they must provide safe and working\nplumbing and heating, and keep the premises free from roaches and rats. If there is a health or safety\nissue, ask your landlord in writing to repair it, and keep copies of your requests.\nYour landlord must return your security deposit. Your landlord must itemize any deductions from your\nsecurity deposit within 21 days of you moving out. Deductions can be made for things like unpaid rent,\ncleaning, and repairing damage beyond ordinary wear and tear.\nYour landlord must provide reasonable accommodations if you have a disability. Your landlord must also\nallow you to make reasonable physical modifications to your rental unit.\nYour landlord cannot discriminate against you. Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual\norientation, disability status, marital status, income source, veteran status, or certain other characteristics\nis illegal.\nYour landlord may not retaliate against you for exercising your tenant rights. Your landlord also cannot\nthreaten to disclose your immigration status to pressure you to move out, or harass or retaliate against you\nby disclosing your immigration status to law enforcement.\nYou may have additional rights. You may have additional rights under local rent control, rent stabilization,\nor just cause eviction laws.

Rent increases are capped at “5% plus the percentage\nchange in the cost of living,” with a maximum annual rent increase of 10%. How much your rent can\nbe increased depends on where you live and when the rent increase takes effect. For convenience, this\nchart shows the maximum rent increase currently allowed under the Tenant Protection Act. This chart is\ninformational only; the maximum allowable rent increase is governed by Civil Code section 1947.12(a).\nIncrease starts between Increase starts between\nArea1\n8/1/24 and 7/31/25 8/1/25 and 7/31/26\nLos Angeles Area:\n• Los Angeles County 8.9% 8%\n• Orange County\nRiverside Area:\n• Riverside County 9.3% 7.5%\n• San Bernardino County\nSan Diego Area:\n8.6% 8.8%\n• San Diego County\nSan Francisco Area:\n• Alameda County\n• Contra Costa County\n8.8% 6.3%\n• Marin County\n• San Francisco County\n• San Mateo County\nAll Other Counties 8.8% 7.7%\nFor rent increases taking effect before or after the dates shown above, please see Civil Code section\n1947.12.\n1 The change in the cost of living is measured using April Consumer Price Index information published by the U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics for the Los Angeles Area, Riverside Area, San Francisco Area, and San Diego Area. For all other\ncounties, the change in the cost of living is measured using April California Consumer Price Index information published\nby the California Department of Industrial Relations. If no April data is available, March data is used.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General\n\nThese rent-increase caps apply to most rental housing2 in California that is more than 15 years old,\nincluding single-family homes and condos owned by corporations, mobilehomes rented from mobilehome\npark management, and housing rented by Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher recipients.\nIn addition to this statewide cap, your city or county may have stronger rent-control laws. Check your city’s\nand county’s webpages and other local resources to see whether there are other rent-increase protections\nwhere you live. If you believe that you have been the victim of an unlawful rent increase, seek legal\nassistance immediately.\n2 The rent-increase cap does not apply to mobilehome owners or to the following types of homes:\n• Units built within the last 15 years (calculated on a rolling basis);\n• Units restricted by deed, regulatory restriction, or other recorded document as affordable housing for very\nlow, low, or moderate-income households, or that are subject to an agreement providing housing subsidies for\naffordable housing for those households;\n• Dormitories owned and operated by institutions of higher education or other schools;\n• Units subject to a more restrictive rent cap;\n• A two-unit property within a single structure, where the property owner lives in one unit during the entire\ntenancy; and\n• Single-family homes and condominiums(a) that are not owned by a real estate investment trust, a corporation,\nan LLC with at least one corporate member, or management of a mobilehome park; AND (b) where the landlord\nnotified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the Tenant Protection Act’s rent limits or “just\ncause” requirements.\nCalifornia Department of Justice Office of the Attorney General"

      "reference_material_content": "U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nFact Sheet: Pregnancy\nDiscrimination\nThis technical assistance document was issued upon approval of the Chair of\nthe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nOLC Control EEOC-NVTA-0000-11\nNumber:\nConcise Display Fact Sheet: Pregnancy Discrimination\nName:\nIssue Date: 01-15-1997\nGeneral Topics: Sex/Pregnancy\nSummary: This document addresses information about pregnancy\ndiscrimination under Title VII, as amended by the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA).\nCitation: Title VII, 29 CFR Part 16\nDocument Employees, Employers, Applicants, HR Practitioners\nApplicant:\nPrevious No\nRevision:\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are\nnot meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to\nprovide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or\nagency policies.\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is an amendment to Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related\nmedical conditions constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII. Women\naffected by pregnancy or related conditions must be treated in the same manner as\nother applicants or employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work.\nHiring and Working Conditions\nAn employer cannot refuse to hire a woman because of her pregnancy related\ncondition as long as she is able to perform the major functions of her job. An\nemployer cannot refuse to hire her because of its prejudices against pregnant\nworkers or because of the prejudices of co-workers, clients, or customers. The PDA\nalso forbids discrimination based on pregnancy when it comes to any other aspect\nof employment, including pay, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, fringe\nbenefits, firing, and any other term or condition of employment.\nPregnancy and Maternity Leave\nAn employer may not single out pregnancy related conditions for medical clearance\nprocedures that are not required of employees who are similar in their ability or\ninability to work. For example, if an employer requires its employees to submit a\ndoctor's statement concerning their inability to work before granting leave or\npaying sick benefits, the employer may require employees affected by pregnancy\nrelated conditions to do the same.\nPregnant employees must be permitted to work as long as they are able to perform\ntheir jobs. If an employee has been absent from work as a result of a pregnancy\nrelated condition and recovers, her employer may not require her to remain on\nleave until the baby's birth. Nor may an employer have a rule that prohibits an\nemployee from returning to work for a predetermined length of time after\nchildbirth.\nUnder the PDA, an employer that allows temporarily disabled employees to take\ndisability leave or leave without pay must allow an employee who is temporarily\n\ndisabled due to pregnancy to do the same. Employers must hold open a job for a\npregnancy related absence the same length of time that jobs are held open for\nemployees on sick or temporary disability leave.\nFurther, under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, enforced by the\nU.S. Department of Labor, a new parent (including foster and adoptive parents) may\nbe eligible for 12 weeks of leave (unpaid, or paid if the employee has earned or\naccrued it) that may be used for care of the new child. To be eligible, the employee\nmust have worked for the employer for 12 months prior to taking the leave and the\nemployer must have a specified number of employees. For more information\nplease see: www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm\n(http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm) .\nPregnancy and Temporary Disability\nIf an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job due to pregnancy, the\nemployer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled employee; for\nexample, by providing light duty, modified tasks, alternative assignments, disability\nleave, or leave without pay.\nAdditionally, impairments resulting from pregnancy (for example, gestational\ndiabetes) may be disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). An\nemployer may have to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability related\nto pregnancy, absent undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense). For\nexample, an employer may be required to provide modified duties for an employee\nwith a 20-pound lifting restriction stemming from pregnancy related sciatica, absent\nundue hardship. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 makes it much easier to show\nthat a medical condition is a covered disability. For more information about the\nADA, see https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination\n(https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-disability-related-resources) . For information\nabout the ADA Amendments Act, see https://www.eeoc.gov/regulations-related-\ndisability-discrimination (https://www.eeoc.gov/regulations-related-disability-\ndiscrimination) .\n\nHealth Insurance\nAny health insurance provided by an employer must cover expenses for pregnancy\nrelated conditions on the same basis as expenses for other medical conditions. The\nPDA specifies, however, that insurance coverage for expenses arising from abortion\nis not required, except where the life of the mother is endangered or medical\ncomplications arise from an abortion.\nPregnancy related expenses should be reimbursed in the same manner as those\nincurred for other medical conditions, whether payment is on a fixed basis or a\npercentage of reasonable and customary charge basis. The amounts payable by the\ninsurance provider can be limited only to the same extent as costs for other\nconditions. No additional or larger deductible can be imposed.\nUnder Title VII, benefits can be denied for medical costs arising from an existing\npregnancy if a health insurance plan excludes benefit payments for pre-existing\nconditions. Other laws, however, may apply to the coverage of pre-existing\nconditions.\nEmployers must provide the same level of health benefits for spouses of male\nemployees as they do for spouses of female employees.\nEqual Access to Benefits\nIf an employer provides any benefits to workers on medical leave, the employer\nmust provide the same benefits for those on medical leave for pregnancy related\nconditions.\nEmployees with pregnancy related disabilities must be treated the same as other\ntemporarily disabled employees for accrual and crediting of seniority, vacation\ncalculation, pay increases, and temporary disability benefits."

      "reference_material_content": "WHAT IS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (UI)?\nUnemployment Insurance is a joint state-federal program that\nUI Benefits are Administered by\nprovides cash benefits to eligible workers. Each state administers\nStates\na separate UI program, but all states follow the same guidelines\nestablished by federal law. To find information about your state’s\nprogram, including eligibility, benefits,\nUnemployment insurance payments (benefits) are intended to and application information, visit our\nprovide temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers Unemployment Insurance Service\nwho are unemployed through no fault of their own. Each state Locator.\nsets its own additional requirements for eligibility, benefit\namounts, and length of time benefits can be paid.\nGenerally, benefits are based on a percentage of your earnings over a recent 52-week period, and each state\nsets a maximum amount. Benefits are subject to federal and most state income taxes and must be reported on\nyour income tax return. You may choose to have the tax withheld from your payment.\nAM I ELIGIBLE?\nEach state sets its own guidelines for eligibility for UI benefits, but you usually qualify if you:\n Are unemployed through no fault of your own. In most states, this means you have to have\nseparated from your last job due to a lack of available work.\n Meet work and wage requirements. You must meet your state’s requirements for wages earned or\ntime worked during an established period of time referred to as a \"base period.\" (In most states, this is\nusually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that your claim is\nfiled.)\n Meet any additional state requirements. Find details of your own state’s program by using our\nUnemployment Insurance Service Locator.\nHOW DO I APPLY?\nTo receive UI benefits, you need to file a claim with the UI program in the state where you worked.\n You should contact your state's UI program as soon as possible after becoming unemployed. Find your\nstate's program by using our Unemployment Insurance Service Locator and check with them to see if\nyou should file a claim in person, by telephone, or online.\n Generally, you should file your claim with the state where you worked. If you worked in a state other\nthan the one where you now live or if you worked in multiple states, the state UI agency where you now\nlive can provide information about how to file your claim with other states.\n When you file a claim, you will be asked for certain information, such as addresses and dates of your\nformer employment. To make sure your claim is not delayed, be sure to give complete and correct\ninformation.\n It generally takes two to three weeks after you file your claim to receive your first benefit check. Some\nstates require a one-week waiting period; in other words, you would receive your first payment for the\nsecond week of your unemployment claim.\nFact Sheet 1\n\nHOW DO I STAY ELIGIBLE?\nGenerally states require the following in order to maintain weekly eligibility:\n File weekly or biweekly claims, usually by mail or phone.\n Be able to work, available to work, and activly seek work each week you claim benefits.\n Report any earnings from work you had during the week(s). States have different rules for how much\nmoney you can earn while receiving benefits.\n Report any job offers or job offers you decline during the week.\n If requested, report to your local UI claims office or American Job Center on the scheduled day\nand time. Benefits may be denied for those who do not attend.\n Some states require registration for work with the State Employment Service, so it can assist you in\nfinding employment.\n Meet any other state eligibility requirements.\nYou will find help in your job search at your local American Job Center. They have a variety of services free of\ncharge. Staff there can:\n Refer you to job openings in your area, or in other areas if you plan to relocate.\n Help with resume writing, interview practice, and other job search activities.\n Refer you to training programs.\n Some Centers offer testing and counseling to help you explore new careers.\n If you believe you have special needs or considerations, such as physical needs or other\nconsiderations, which may prevent you from getting a job, they can refer you to other agencies for\nhelp with those needs.\nWHAT IF I AM DENIED?\nEach state UI Program makes its own decisions about workers’ eligibility for benefits. There are many reasons\nfor denying benefit payments; some of the most common are:\n Voluntarily leaving work without good cause. Benefit payments can be paid if you quit under certain\ncircumstances depending on your state's laws.\n Being discharged for misconduct connected with work. Misconduct is an intentional or controllable act\nor failure to take action, which shows a deliberate disregard of the employer's interests.\n Not being able or available for work. You must be able, ready and willing to accept a suitable job.\n Not actively seeking work.\n Refusing an offer of suitable work.\n Knowingly making false statements to obtain benefit payments.\nIf you are disqualified or denied benefits, you have the right to file an appeal. Your employer may also appeal a\ndetermination if he/she does not agree with the state's determination regarding your eligibility. You must file\nyour appeal within an established time frame.\nFact Sheet 2\n\nHOW LONG WILL MY BENEFITS LAST?\nIn general, benefits are based on a percentage of an individual's earnings over a recent 52-week period -\nup to a State maximum amount.\n Benefits can be paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most States.\n Additional weeks of benefits called Extended Benefits may be available during times of high\nunemployment (Some States also provide additional benefits for specific purposes).\n Benefits are subject to Federal income taxes and must be reported on the individual’s Federal income\ntax return. Or the individual may elect to have the tax withheld by the State Unemployment Insurance\nagency.\nYou can visit the Comparison of State UI Laws at https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/statelaws.asp#Statelaw for\nadditional information about the maximum weeks of entitlement and other state specific UI laws.\nFact Sheet 3"

      "reference_material_content": "Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\nSection 203 of the Voting Rights Act\nPublished April 2024\nIn our diverse country, English is not the primary language of many American citizens, and many\nhave limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. Citizens with limited-English\nproficiency need information in languages other than English to be informed voters and participate\neffectively in our democracy. Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”) protects the voting rights\nof many of these Americans.\nSection 203 of the Voting Rights Act1\nSection 203 aims to ensure that citizens have an effective opportunity to register to vote, learn the\ndetails of elections, and cast an informed ballot.\nCongress amended the VRA in 1975 to include Section 203 because it found that Hispanic, Asian\nAmerican, Native American, and Alaskan Native citizens (“language minorities”) had been “effectively\nexcluded from participation in the electoral process.” To protect their constitutional rights, Congress\nstated, “it is necessary to eliminate such discrimination.”\nWhat language communities are covered by Section 203?\nSection 203 protects citizens of “language minorities”: Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans,\nand Alaskan Natives.\n1 | Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\n1 This guide provides information on the rights of language minority groups under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. The guide does not impose legal\nobligations and is not intended to be comprehensive.\n\nWho must offer materials and assistance in languages other than English?\nEvery five years, the United States Census Bureau releases a list of jurisdictions (for example,\ncounties and cities) that must provide election-related materials and assistance in one or more non-\nEnglish languages. The Census Bureau applies a formula in Section 203 to generate this list. In\nsome places, two or more language minority groups are present in numbers sufficient to trigger\nSection 203 requirements. The most recent list of covered jurisdictions, released in December 2021,\nis at www.justice.gov/crt/about-language-minority-voting-rights.\nHow does a jurisdiction know it is covered under Section 203?\nFollowing the Census Bureau’s determinations, the United States Department of Justice\n(“Department”) notifies jurisdictions that they are covered under Section 203.\nWhat does Section 203 require covered jurisdictions to do?\nCovered jurisdictions that provide election-related materials and oral language assistance in English\nmust also make those materials and assistance available in the required non-English language so that\ncitizens can participate effectively in elections. Section 203’s requirements apply to all stages of the\nvoting process, from registering to vote to conducting elections and casting a ballot.\nWhat elections are subject to Section 203?\nThe requirements of Section 203 apply to any type of federal, state, or local election within a covered\njurisdiction, including general, primary, and special elections.\nAccurately Translated and Effectively Distributed Bilingual\nElection Materials\nWhat election-related materials must be translated?\nWhen covered jurisdictions provide any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance,\nballots, or other materials or information about the voting process or election, they must provide\nthose materials in both English and the required minority language.\n2 | Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\n\nCovered jurisdictions must ensure that the written information and materials in the required non-\nEnglish language are clear, complete, and accurately translated.\nTranslations must be accurate and meet the needs of the language minority community. Local\nofficials should consult with members of the covered language minority group regarding the accuracy\nof the translated materials and any variations unique to the language minority community, such as\nsignificant differences in dialects.\nFor historically unwritten languages, jurisdictions should work with language minority communities to\ndetermine how best to communicate election information to eligible voters.\nBilingual Election Personnel and Poll Workers\nHow is oral language assistance provided to language minority voters under Section\n203?\nJurisdictions covered under Section 203 must provide oral assistance to allow voters of language\nminority communities to participate effectively in the voting process.\nThey typically do this by staffing bilingual poll workers at polling places that need them. It is\nimportant that poll workers be trained on the language assistance requirements of the VRA.\nTo determine the number of bilingual poll workers needed at a polling place, covered jurisdictions\nshould consider information such as how many members of the covered language minority group are\nregistered voters in a precinct and their English proficiency.\nOutreach to the community can help local election officials identify and recruit bilingual poll officials\nand workers.\n3 | Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\n\nCommunity Involvement and Outreach\nHow can election officials include members of the community and other stakeholders in\nthe development of a bilingual election program?\nLanguage minority community members and other advocates and stakeholders can help develop and\nmaintain an effective bilingual election program.\nTo implement an effective program that meets legal requirements and language community needs,\nlocal election officials should confer with a broad range of contacts in the language minority\ncommunity and organizations that work with that community.\nElection officials should also consult members of their language minority communities to learn the\nbest ways to publicize election information, recruit bilingual workers, and meet voters’ needs. This\npublicity should include the use of minority language media, where available, and accurately\ntranslated materials on election websites.\nHow can community members participate in a bilingual election program?\nCommunity members can contact local elections officials, as well as city and county officials, to make\nsuggestions and participate actively in the minority language election program. Bilingual community\nmembers can also volunteer to serve as poll workers, provide feedback on translated materials, or\nassist in identifying the language needs of limited-English proficient voters.\nMembers of the community should report any Section 203 compliance problems to local election\nofficials and, if those officials do not adequately address the problems, notify the Department at 1-\n(800) 253-3931 or at www.civilrights.justice.gov.\n4 | Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\n\nThe Role of the United States Department of Justice\nWhat is the Department’s role in ensuring covered jurisdictions provide the necessary\nassistance to limited-English proficient voters?\nTo inform The Department notifies jurisdictions that they are covered under Section 203 and\ninforms communities about the law and language assistance requirements.\nTo assist The Department provides information to jurisdictions on developing and implementing a\nsuccessful language assistance program and answers questions about complying with language\nassistance requirements.\nThe Department also offers guidance to local election officials on how to comply with Section 203.\nThese guidelines are entitled “Implementation of the Provisions of the Voting Rights Act Regarding\nLanguage Minority Groups.” 28 C.F.R. Part 55 (www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/927236/dl?inline).\nTo enforce The Department investigates alleged violations of Section 203 and takes appropriate\nenforcement action to stop violations.\nLearning More and Contacting the United States Department of\nJustice\nWhere can I find more information about Section 203?\nYou can find information about Section 203, including its full text, a list of covered jurisdictions, and\nthe United States Attorney General’s Minority Language Guidelines online at\nwww.justice.gov/crt/about-language-minority-voting-rights.\nHow do I contact the Department about Section 203?\nYou can contact the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department by calling 1-(800)\n253-3931 or by completing a form at www.civilrights.justice.gov.\n5 | Voting Protections for Language Minority Citizens\n\nU.

      "reference_material_content": "Fact Sheet: Protecting Against Voter Intimidation\nIs voter intimidation illegal?\nYes. The right of each voter to cast his or her ballot free from intimidation or coercion is a foundational principle of\na free and democratic society. Federal law prohibits voter intimidation.\nMultiple federal statutes make it a crime to intimidate voters: it is illegal to intimidate, threaten, or coerce a person, or\nattempt to do so, “for the purpose of interfering with” that person’s right “to vote or to vote as he may choose.” 18\nU.S.C. § 594. It is also a crime to knowingly and willfully intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person, or attempt to do\nso, for “registering to vote, or voting,” or for “urging or aiding” anyone to vote or register to vote. 52\nU.S.C. § 20511(1). And it is a crime to “by force or threat of force” willfully injure, intimidate, or interfere with any\nperson because he or she is voting or has voted or “in order to intimidate” anyone from voting. 18\nU.S.C. § 245(b)(1)(A).\nFederal law also provides for civil lawsuits based on voter intimidation. Section 11 of the Voting Rights Act makes it\nunlawful to “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” another person, or attempt to do so, “for voting or attempting to vote”\nor “for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b). And Section 2 of the Ku Klux\nKlan Act of 1871 makes it unlawful for “two or more persons to conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat,”\nany voter from casting a ballot for the candidate of his or her choice. 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).\nEvery state also separately prohibits interference with voters and/or voter intimidation.\nWhat are examples of voter intimidation?\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has explained that voter intimidation is conduct that is intended to compel prospective\nvoters to vote against their preferences, or to not vote at all, through activity that is reasonably calculated to instill\nfear. Some actions that ordinarily would be legal may be unlawful if they are intended to intimidate voters.\nVoter intimidation is often subtle and context-dependent, so it can be difficult to identify in advance. Here are some\nexamples of conduct near polling sites that likely would constitute illegal voter intimidation, although other conduct\ncould also qualify:\n• Violent behavior inside or outside the polling • Verbal threats of violence\nsite\n• Confronting voters while wearing military-style • Spreading false information about voter fraud,\nor official-looking uniforms voting requirements, or related criminal\npenalties\n• Brandishing firearms or the intimidating display • Aggressively approaching voters’ vehicles or\nof firearms writing down voters’ license plate numbers\n• Following voters to, from, or within the polling • Harassing voters, aggressively questioning them\nplace about their qualifications to vote.\nAre guns permitted at polling places?\nSometimes. As the Giffords Law Center explains, states including Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,\nTexas, and the District of Columbia uniformly prohibit guns at polling places, while other states such as Colorado,\nIllinois, New Mexico, and Washington allow concealed weapons at polling places, but prohibit open carrying of\n\nfirearms there. Guns may also be prohibited when polling locations are in K–12 schools or on other property where\nfirearms are not permitted. The Supreme Court has “assume[d] it settled” that firearms can be banned at polling\nplaces. New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 30 (2022).\nEven where guns are not explicitly prohibited, they may not be used to intimidate voters. Nor may armed groups of\nindividuals patrol polling locations or otherwise engage in activities reserved for law enforcement or official state\nmilitias. Fact sheets containing state laws banning private unauthorized militia activity are available at\nhttp://bit.ly/50factsheets.\nDoes the First Amendment protect intimidating speech?\nNot always. The First Amendment does not protect intimidation in the form of “true threats,” “where the speaker\nmeans to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence” against another\nperson or group. Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 360 (2003). Some courts have held that threats of adverse legal,\neconomic, or immigration consequences are also unprotected when directed at voters. For further guidance on this\ntopic, see ICAP’s Fact Sheet: True Threats and the First Amendment.\nEven when speech is not openly threatening, states and localities nonetheless may impose some restrictions on speech\nin order to protect the integrity of elections and the rights of voters to cast their ballots free from intimidation. In\nBurson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992), the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that banned campaigning within\n100 feet of the entrance to a polling place. Nearly every state has a similar law protecting voters against electioneering\nin the immediate vicinity of the polls. Although speech outside this limited distance may be entitled to greater\nprotections, jurisdictions likely could, for example, require any demonstrations to remain a reasonable distance away\nfrom the path that voters must take into the polling place in order to guard against intimidation.\nWhat does it mean to be a poll watcher?\nState law regulates those who are permitted to observe the voting process within a polling place, sometimes called\n“poll watchers” or “election observers,” and what those observers are permitted to do. State law also governs who\nis permitted to challenge a voter’s qualifications to vote and what a challenger must show to make such a\nchallenge. These laws vary from state to state. Election officials should be familiar with these laws to prevent\nunauthorized observation or challenges and to ensure that such activities are not used for purposes of intimidation.\nEven if your qualifications to vote are challenged, you may still cast a regular ballot unless that challenge is sustained,\nand, at a minimum, you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot before leaving the polling site.\nWhat should I do if I see or experience voter intimidation?\n✓ If you fear imminent violence, call 9-1-1.\n✓ Notify your local election official at your polling place.\n✓ Document what you saw or experienced: what happened, where, and when, and\nwhether any voters were deterred from voting.\n✓ Call Election Protection at 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683). Assistance is also available\nin Spanish at 888-VE-Y-VOTA (888- 839-8682), in Arabic at 844-YALLA-US\n(844-915-5187), and Asian languages at 888-API-VOTE (1-888-274-8683). A video\nAmerican Sign Language line is available at 301-818-VOTE (301-818-8683).\nThis guidance was prepared by the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP) at Georgetown University Law Center. ICAP’s\nmission is to use strategic legal advocacy to defend constitutional rights and values, while working to restore confidence in the integrity of governmental\ninstitutions.

      "reference_material_content": "Voting 101\nWho runs (cid:2)elections in my state?(cid:2)\nState and local election officials. (cid:2)They run\nlocal, state, and federal elections, including for\nCongress and for the Presidency. (cid:2)\nIf you want to know how (cid:2)you can vote (cid:2)in your\nstate, (cid:2)you should contact those (cid:2)officials (cid:2)\nbecause the rules are different in different\nstates. (cid:2)\nYou can find more information about your\nstate’s rules and the contact information for\nelection officials at vote.gov.\nProtecting Your Right\nto Vote\nDoes federal law protect my (cid:2)\nright to vote?(cid:2)\nYes.(cid:2) The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. (cid:2)\nDepartment of Justice (cid:2)enforces (cid:2)these laws. (cid:2)\nOften, people whose rights have been violated\ncan also bring private lawsuits. (cid:2)\n1\n\nDoes federal law protect against\ndiscrimination in voting?\nYes.(cid:2) Here are two of the most important\nfederal laws for protecting voters against\ndiscrimination.(cid:2)\nThe (cid:2)first law is (cid:2)the (cid:2)Voting Rights Act, (cid:2)or\n“VRA.” (cid:2)Section 2 of the (cid:2)VRA makes it illegal\nto (cid:2)deny (cid:2)or restrict voting rights because (cid:2)\nof a citizen’s race (cid:2)or color. It also (cid:2)outlaws (cid:2)\ndiscrimination against citizens who are\nmembers (cid:2)of a language minority group, (cid:2)which\nthe (cid:2)VRA defines as including American Indian, (cid:2)\nAsian American, Alaskan Native, (cid:2)or Latino (cid:2)\npersons. (cid:2)\nUnder Section 2, state and local governments (cid:2)\ncannot use voting practices or election rules\nthat are intentionally (cid:2)discriminatory. Nor\ncan they use practices (cid:2)or rules (cid:2)that result in\ncitizens who belong to a particular race or\nlanguage minority group having less (cid:2)of an\nopportunity (cid:2)than everyone (cid:2)else (cid:2)to (cid:2)vote and\nelect the public (cid:2)officials (cid:2)they (cid:2)want.(cid:2)\nThe second law is (cid:2)the Americans (cid:2)with\nDisabilities Act. (cid:2)Title II of that law requires\nstate and local governments (cid:2)to make sure (cid:2)that\npeople with disabilities have a full and equal\nchance (cid:2)to (cid:2)vote. Like Section 2 of the (cid:2)VRA, (cid:2)\nthis law applies (cid:2)to all aspects (cid:2)of voting. This (cid:2)\nincludes registering to vote, getting into polling\nplaces, and casting a ballot, both on Election\nDay and during early (cid:2)voting. You can find more (cid:2)\ninformation at ada.gov.\n2\n\nDo federal laws protect against\nvoter intimidation?\nYes.(cid:2) There are civil and criminal federal\nstatutes (cid:2)that make it illegal to intimidate, (cid:2)\nthreaten or coerce someone for voting or\nattempting to vote, as well as federal statutes\nthat make it illegal to intimidate, (cid:2)threaten or\ncoerce people who are urging or helping others\nto vote.\nThe civil statutes include the Civil Rights Act\nof 1957 and the (cid:2)Voting Rights Act. The (cid:2)criminal\nstatutes appear in several Titles (cid:2)of the U.S. Code.(cid:2)\nVoter Registration\nWhere (cid:2)can I register to (cid:2)vote?(cid:2)\nThe National Voter Registration Act requires (cid:2)\nmost states (all but Idaho, Minnesota, New (cid:2)\nHampshire, North Dakota, (cid:2)Wisconsin, and\nWyoming) to let you register to (cid:2)vote by using\nthe mail. (cid:2)\nIt also requires (cid:2)those same 44 states (cid:2)to let you\nregister to vote through various government\noffices. Some (cid:2)examples are (cid:2)offices (cid:2)that provide (cid:2)\ndriver licenses, public assistance, (cid:2)or disability (cid:2)\nservices, and Armed Forces recruitment\noffices. Your state may also (cid:2)offer other(cid:2) ways (cid:2)\n3\n\nto register, such as at elections (cid:2)offices, (cid:2)voter\nregistration events, a polling place, through the\nmail, (cid:2)or online.(cid:2)\nIf you’re (cid:2)eligible (cid:2)to register, states must\nlet you vote in a federal election as long as (cid:2)\nyour registration application is postmarked\nor received by (cid:2)the right office at least 30\ndays before (cid:2)that election. In some states, (cid:2)\nthe deadline is even closer to the election;\nand some (cid:2)other states permit Election Day (cid:2)\nregistration. (cid:2)\nPlease (cid:2)check your state’s (cid:2)elections (cid:2)website for\nspecific (cid:2)information about the requirements (cid:2)\nand deadlines. You can find that website by (cid:2)\ngoing to vote.gov.\nWhen can I be (cid:2)taken off the (cid:2)voter\nregistration list?\nUnder Section 8 of the National Voter\nRegistration Act, (cid:2)officials (cid:2)can take (cid:2)you off the (cid:2)\nvoter registration list for federal elections if\nyou ask them to, (cid:2)or if you die. (cid:2)\nYou can also be (cid:2)taken off the list if you move (cid:2)\naway, as long as (cid:2)officials follow (cid:2)the NVRA’s (cid:2)\nrules about notice and timing. You cannot\nbe removed from the registration list solely (cid:2)\nbecause (cid:2)you did not vote in an election. But you\ncan be (cid:2)taken off if you do not answer a notice (cid:2)\nasking you to (cid:2)confirm whether you have moved, (cid:2)\nand then you do not vote (cid:2)within the next two (cid:2)\nfederal election cycles.(cid:2)\nMany states (cid:2)will also (cid:2)take (cid:2)you off the list if you\nare convicted of certain crimes or judged to be\nmentally incapacitated. (cid:2)\n4\n\nCan I vote if I moved and forgot\nto update my (cid:2)voter registration\naddress?(cid:2)\nIt depends. (cid:2)Suppose (cid:2)you moved within an\narea covered by (cid:2)the same (cid:2)polling place (for(cid:2)\nexample, (cid:2)you just moved down the block). Then\nthe National Voter Registration Act allows (cid:2)you\nto (cid:2)vote at that polling place. But you should\nupdate (cid:2)your address (cid:2)with election officials (cid:2)\n(which you can do at the polling place (cid:2)when you\nvote) so (cid:2)that it is (cid:2)correct for future (cid:2)elections. (cid:2)\nSuppose (cid:2)you moved to an address (cid:2)that has a\ndifferent polling place, (cid:2)but you still live (cid:2)within\nthe same registrar’s jurisdiction (for example, (cid:2)\nsomewhere in the same (cid:2)city) and the same (cid:2)\nCongressional district. Then you may (cid:2)vote at\nyour old polling place. And in some states, (cid:2)\nyou may also be allowed to (cid:2)vote at your new (cid:2)\npolling place or a central location, such as the\nregistrar’s (cid:2)office, instead of your old polling\nplace. Again, (cid:2)you should update (cid:2)your address (cid:2)\nwith election officials (which you can do at the (cid:2)\npolling place (cid:2)when you vote) so (cid:2)that it is (cid:2)correct\nfor future (cid:2)elections. (cid:2)\nSuppose (cid:2)you have not moved, but the (cid:2)\nregistration records incorrectly say (cid:2)that you\nhave. Then you have (cid:2)the right to (cid:2)vote at your\npolling place (cid:2)once (cid:2)you affirm that you continue (cid:2)\nto live (cid:2)where (cid:2)you were registered. (cid:2)\nPlease (cid:2)check your state’s (cid:2)elections (cid:2)website (cid:2)\nfor information regarding your proper polling\nplace. You can find that website by going to (cid:2)\nvote.gov.\n5\n\nFinally, federal law protects (cid:2)your right to (cid:2)vote (cid:2)\nin presidential elections if you moved shortly (cid:2)\nbefore Election Day (cid:2)or if you are (cid:2)out of state (cid:2)on\nElection Day. This right is protected by Section\n202 of the (cid:2)Voting Rights Act. (cid:2)\nWhat if I registered to vote\nbut my name is not listed in\nthe poll book?(cid:2)\nIn most states, (cid:2)you can get a “provisional\nballot” (cid:2)to (cid:2)vote in federal elections after you\nassert that you are registered and eligible. (cid:2)\nSection 302 of the Help America Vote Act sets (cid:2)\nout some rules about this. You may also be (cid:2)\noffered a provisional ballot if an election official\nasserts (cid:2)you are not eligible (cid:2)to (cid:2)vote. (cid:2)\nState laws may provide (cid:2)other reasons for giving\nyou a provisional ballot—for example, if you do (cid:2)\nnot bring the state’s required ID when you go (cid:2)to (cid:2)\nvote (in a state (cid:2)that requires showing ID to (cid:2)vote)\nor if you have already been sent an absentee (cid:2)\nballot.(cid:2)\nTo (cid:2)vote (cid:2)with a provisional ballot, (cid:2)you must sign\na written affirmation. Your completed ballot will\nthen be held separately from the regular ballots (cid:2)\nuntil an election official determines (cid:2)whether it\nshould be (cid:2)counted. You must be given written\ninstructions about how (cid:2)to (cid:2)find out if your ballot\nwas counted, and if it was not counted, the\nreason why. Under state law, (cid:2)you may also have (cid:2)\nto provide additional information by a specific (cid:2)\ndate for your ballot to be (cid:2)counted.(cid:2)\n6"

This\narea of law is called probate. The probate division of the superior\ncourt handles these issues.\nWhat is probate\nProbate is the legal process that you must\nfollow to transfer or inherit property after the\nperson who owned the property has passed\naway\n\nDepending on the amount and type of property the deceased\nperson owned, you may or may not need to go to court to\ntransfer or inherit the property. All of the property legally\nowned by the deceased person is called the person’s “estate.”\nIf you need to go to court, this is commonly called \"going\nthrough probate.\" A person's estate may need to go through\nprobate even if they had a will.\nIf you find an original will, you must deliver it to the court.\nLearn more\nDelivering a will to the court is called “lodging the\nwill.” You must also send a copy of the will to the\nexecutor named in the will. If you cannot find the\nexecutor, then send it to a person named in the will as\na beneficiary.\nTo start a probate case (called opening probate), you go to\ncourt and ask a judge to appoint a personal representative.\nThe personal representative is the person responsible for\nrepresenting the estate in the probate process. The personal\nrepresentative collects all the property of the person that\ndied, pays their bills, and then distributes any remaining\nproperty to the people with a legal right to receive the\nproperty (called heirs or beneficiaries).\n\nThe probate court also handles other types of cases, like\nguardianships and conservatorships. Learn more.\nThe probate court also handles other types of cases,\nlike when an adult that is not a child's parent asks for\ncustody of the child (called guardianship) or when an\nadult asks for the right to act or makes decisions for\nanother adult with a disability or impairment (called\nconservatorship).\n\nLEGAL TERMS USED IN PROBATE\nYou will need to learn a lot of legal terms to\nunderstand what to do in probate. For example, the\nproperty that a person leaves behind when they die is\ncalled the “decedent’s estate.”\nDecedent: the person who died\nEstate: the property the person owned when\nthey died\nIntestate succession: the laws that say who\ninherits something if the person did not have a\nwill or trust\nVerify: Most documents filed in a probate court\nmust be verified, that is, sworn or affirmed to be\ntrue “under penalty of perjury.\" Form MC-030\nhas the required verification statement.\nTo help, there's a list of definitions you may need to\nknow to fill out or understand forms or instructions.\nDoes the estate need to go\nthrough probate?\n\nTo inherit property from someone who has passed away, you\nwill first need to figure out what process you can use to\ntransfer the property. You may need to go to court, but in\nsome cases, you do not. One of the first things to do is check\nwho the right person is to handle these matters.\nWho is the right person to handle probate\nmatters?\nTypically, the person named in the will or a close relative if\nthere is not a will handles the probate matters. Two or more\npeople can represent an estate together. But they must act\nalways act together.\nIf the person had a will or trust, the person listed as in\ncharge (often called an executor) will generally handle\nany probate. If they cannot or do not want to, then it will\noften be a relative.\nIf the person did not have a will or trust, often a close\nrelative will handle any probate. If the person was\nmarried when they died, their spouse is often the person.\nOr, if they have adult children, then an adult\nchild. Relatives should generally talk to each other to\ndecide who and how decisions will be made for the\nestate.\n\nIf the transfer of property needs to go through probate,\na judge will appoint someone as a personal\nrepresentative of the estate. The law gives preference\n(also called priority) to who this will be. This is often the\nperson named in the will. If the person named in the will\ncannot act or there is no will, then there's an order of\npriority for who may be appointed a personal\nrepresentative. The order of priority is any surviving\nspouse or domestic partner, then a child, then a\ngrandchild, then a parent, and then a sibling. A judge will\nneed to decide which person has priority.\nEven if someone was not named in a will, the person who\ndied might have named them as a beneficiary, for example on\nretirement or bank account. These people may also have\ndecisions to make or steps to take to claim the property.\nHow does the person handling probate\nmatters figure out what process to use?\nThe next sections offer the basics of how to figure out what\nprocess you can use to transfer property. To do this, you first\nneed to organize all the information about what the person\nowns and owes, and then consider the options.\n\nTalk to a lawyer to get specific answers about your\nsituation. You can usually pay the lawyer’s fees\nfrom the property in the estate.\nCALIFORNIA COURTS | SELF HELP\nGUIDE"

      "reference_material_content": "When There Is No Will\nWhen a person dies without leaving a Last Will and Testament, it's said that they died intestate. When a person\ndies intestate, that person's property is distributed according to the law. In New York, that law is found in EPTL 4-\n1.1.\nWho gets what depends on who the living relatives are and their relationship to the Decedent, the person who\ndied. The family members who are entitled to a share of the Decedent's estate when there is no will are called\n\"distributees\".\nIn the simplest terms:\nIf the Decedent has... then\na spouse (husband or wife) and no children the spouse inherits everything\nchildren* but no spouse children inherit everything\nthe spouse inherits the first $50,000 plus half of the balance. The\nspouse and children*\nchildren* inherit everything else.\nparents but no spouse and no children* the parents inherit everything\nsiblings (brothers or sisters) but no spouse,\nthe siblings inherit everything\nchildren*, or parents\n* If a child dies before the Decedent and had children of their own, then the Decedent would have grandchildren. Those\ngrandchildren would step into the Decedent's child's place and inherit in place of the child.\nAbout Decedent's Children\nFor children to inherit from their parents, New York State requires that there is legal parent-child relationship. In\nmost cases this is not an issue but it's not always clear.\nAdopted children will inherit just like a biological child.\nFoster children and stepchildren will not inherit unless they were legally adopted.\nChildren born after the Decedent dies will inherit.\nChildren born outside of marriage, also called non-marital child, will inherit from a male Decedent if\npaternity is established\nGrandchildren will inherit only if their parent (the Decedent's child) dies before the Decedent died.\nIf the Decedent has no family at all, then the property will go to New York State.\nWho Can File An Estate Proceeding\nIf there is a Will, then the Executor named in the Will files for probate or a small estate in the Surrogate's Court\nin the county where the Decedent had their primary residence.\nIf there is no Will, then there is a rule for who can file for administration or a small estate. In general, the \"closest\ndistributee\" can file for administration or small estate. This means that the Decedent's husband or wife has a\nprior right over the Decedent's children to file. But if the Decedent didn't have a living husband or wife, then the\nDecedent's children have equal rights to each other. If the relative with the prior right does not want to administer\nthe estate, then they can sign a renunciation and waiver. In the same way, if relatives have equal rights (such as\n\na Decedent's son and daughter) in an administration proceeding, then the Decedent's children sign waivers. This\ndoes not mean that they are giving up their share of the Decedent's estate.\nRelated Information:\nSmall Estate\nAdministration\nProbate\nHow to Get a Copy of the Death Certificate\nWeb page updated: October 11, 2018\n\nAdministration\n- When a Person Dies with No Will\nWhen the person who died (the Decedent) did not have a Will a proceeding called an Administration can be filed\nin the Surrogate’s Court to collect and distribute their belongings. If the Decedent had less than $50,000 of\npersonal property and died either with a Will or without a Will, then a small estate, also called a Voluntary\nAdministration proceeding, can be filed. If the Decedent had less than $50,000 of personal property and died\nwith a Will, a probate proceeding can be filed instead.\nAdministration is the process where the Surrogate's Court officially gives out Letters of Administration to a\nqualified distributee (heir) of the Decedent. Letters of Administration appoints a Decedent's distributee (heir) and\ngives them the authority to gather and give out the Decedent's property according to the law.\nIf the Decedent's only asset is real property (real estate), it may not be necessary to file an administration\nproceeding depending on who survives the Decedent. According to the law, real property is granted to the\nDecedent's distributees (heirs) at the time of death, which makes the distributees the owners of the property. It\nmight be a good idea to contact a real estate attorney and the tax office to get more information about this.\nFiling for Administration\nIn New York there is a rule for who can file the Administration proceeding. In general, the person who is the\nclosest distributee (family member) to the Decedent files for administration. See order of priority of family\nmember distributees who can file the Administration proceeding When There Is No Will.\nThe closest distributee files a copy of the paid funeral bill, a certified death certificate with the Petition for\nLetters of Administration and other supporting documents in the Surrogate's Court in the county where the\nDecedent had their primary residence. If you know the debts of the Decedent (such as medical bills, credit card\nbills, etc.) you should make a list of them. You should also make a list of what the Decedent owned at the time of\ndeath (such as bank accounts, house, stocks, etc.). You may be able to file the papers over the internet using\nNYSCEF, the New York State Courts Electronic Filing system. Check to see if you can do this on the e-filing\nCounty List for the Surrogate's Court in your county.\nThe Decedent's distributees must also be listed in the petition. Distributees must be served (officially given) a\nnotice, called a citation. The citation gives the Surrogate's Court jurisdiction over them. This means that the\nSurrogate's Court has the power to decide the rights of the people involved. A citation tells the distributee that\nsomeone is asking for Letters of Administration to manage the Decedent's estate. The distributee can sign a\nwaiver (giving up their rights) and consent to the appointment of the Administrator or come to court to disagree\nwith the appointment. There may also be a waiver of bond included.\nThe filing fee is based on the dollar value of the estate.\nRelated Information:\nWhen There Is No Will\nFiduciary\nHow to Get a Death Certificate\nSmall Estate\nWeb page updated: October 6, 2021"

      "reference_material_content": "Powers of Attorney Fact Sheet\nAbout Powers of Attorney: what they can and\ncannot do.\nComposed by Texas RioGrande Legal Aid • Last\nEdited on January 13, 2023\nHere, learn about powers of attorney, which are\nlegal documents that authorize one person to act on\nbehalf of another. They can be broad or limited and\ncan be revoked.\nWhat is a power of attorney?\nIt is a legal document that authorizes one person to\nact on behalf of another. The person who creates\nthe power is the principal. The person who acts on\nbehalf of the principal is the agent. The powers\nauthorized in a power of attorney can be very broad\nor limited to a specific purpose or transaction. A\npower of attorney is not a court order and cannot be\nenforced like a court order. A court order always\nprevails over a power of attorney.\nWhat kind of power of attorney do I\nneed?\n\nIt depends on the actions you would like the agent\nto take on your behalf.\nIf you want to buy a house but cannot attend the\nclosing, you can give someone a special power of\nattorney.\nA power of attorney for a nonparent caregiver gives\nan agent permission to make decisions for a child\nthat a parent would usually make.\nA statutory or durable power of attorney gives an\nagent permission to access bank accounts, sell\nproperty and make other important decisions when\nthe principal becomes incapacitated or unable to\nmake decisions. It stays in effect until revoked or until\nthe principal dies.\nA general power of attorney does the same thing as a\nstatutory power of attorney, except that it expires\nautomatically if the principal becomes incompetent.\nWho can make a power of attorney?\nAnyone at least 18 years of age and of sound mind\ncan create a power of attorney. “Sound mind”\nmeans that the person signing the power of attorney\nunderstands what they are signing and the acts\nthey have authorized the agent to perform on their\nbehalf.\n\nHow long does a power of attorney\nlast?\nIt depends on what powers are authorized and for\nwhat purpose. Some powers of attorney state the\nending or expiration date in the document. Others\nautomatically expire when the principal becomes\nincapacitated. A durable power of attorney ends\nwith the death of the principal.\nDo third parties have to accept my\npower of attorney?\nNo. Businesses usually accept payments through a\npower of attorney, and banks will usually accept\ndeposits made by the agent into the principal’s\naccount. However, many financial institutions will\nnot allow an agent to withdraw funds or close an\naccount. Some banks have their own power of\nattorney form and will not accept any other.\nWho should be my agent?\nYour agent acts in your name. In most cases, you\nare responsible for the acts of your agent performed\nin your name. Choose your agent very carefully. Be\n\nespecially cautious when signing a general durable\npower of attorney or statutory power of attorney, as\nthese documents give your agent the authority to do\npractically anything in your name.\nCan my agent tell me what to do?\nNo. A power of attorney only allows your agent to do\nthe things you want to be done for you. It does not\nkeep you from doing something for yourself. If you\ngive someone power of attorney, you can still act on\nyour own behalf. It does not mean that everyone\nmust go through your agent or that your agent has\nthe exclusive right to act and make decisions for\nyou.\nHow do I revoke a power of attorney?\nYou can revoke your power of attorney anytime if\nyou have sufficient mental capacity to understand\nthat you are revoking it. You do not need anyone’s\npermission to revoke it.\n1. Destroy the original power of attorney and any\ncopies.\n2. Although not required, it is always best to have a\nwritten revocation. Prepare a written revocation\n\nstatement with the agent’s name and the date you\nmade the power of attorney you wish to revoke.\n3. Sign the revocation before a notary. You can\nhand-deliver a copy to your agent or send it by\ncertified mail to prove it was received.\n4. Give copies of the revocation to everyone your\nagent dealt with on your behalf, including\nindividuals, businesses, and financial institutions,\nso that they know that the agent no longer acts\nfor you.\nSource URL:\nhttps://texaslawhelp.org/article/powers-of-attorney-\nfact-sheet"

      "reference_material_content": "Debt Collection\nThis article explains your rights and options under\nthe law if you are facing debt collection.\nComposed by Texas RioGrande Legal Aid • Last\nEdited on December 1, 2025\nIf a debt collector is contacting you about a debt, or\nyou have been sued by a debt collector, you have\nrights, which vary depending on what stage of the\ncollection process the matter is in.\n如需本⽂件的中⽂譯本，請向下滾動⾄本⾴底部的「相\n關表格」區段。\n(For a Chinese translation of this\ndocument, scroll down to the \"Related Forms\" section\nat the bottom of this page.)\nDebt collectors are harassing me. Is\nthat legal?\nA federal law called the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act\nprohibits debt collectors from:\nMaking false statements or using offensive language.\nTelling you that failure to pay your debt is a crime, or\nthreatening you with jail time.\n\nThreatening to collect the debt from a third party, like your\nfamily or neighbors.\nThreatening to take your homestead or your paycheck.\nCalling you at work, or calling you between 9 pm and 8 am\n(unless you agree).\nCalling you when it has become aware that an attorney\nrepresents you and has that attorney’s contact information.\nYou can also send a “cease-and-desist” letter to the debt\ncollector by certified mail demanding that they stop\nharassing you at your home or work. Keep a copy for your\nrecords. If the debt collector continues to harass you, you\nmay have grounds for a lawsuit.\nHow can I defend myself against a\nlawsuit from a creditor?\nKnow your rights:\nThe creditor must file a lawsuit within 4 years from the date\nof your last minimum payment or promise to pay on the\ndebt. Even if you owe the debt, you can still challenge it if it’s\nover 4 years from your last payment or promise to pay.\nThe creditor must send you a written demand for payment\n(“demand letter”) at least 30 days before filing a lawsuit\nagainst you.\nIf you don’t owe the debt or the amount is wrong, reply to the\ndemand letter within 30 days. For a form reply, go to What\nshould I do when a debt collector contacts me?\n\nThe collection agency must provide a copy of the creditor\ncontract if you ask for it. If the creditor has sold your debt\nto a collection agency, the agency is required to keep a\ncopy of the contract between you and the original creditor\non file that shows your account number with the original\ncreditor. You have a legal right to ask for a copy of this\ncontract to make the collection agency prove that they\nhave the authority to collect the debt. Often the debt\ncollection agency would rather not go through the trouble\nof locating, copying and sending you a copy of the creditor\ncontract and will simply stop collection efforts against you\nrather than go through these extra steps.\nHow will I know if I’m being sued?\nYou will be served with legal papers by mail or by a\nprocess server. The first page is the “citation,” which will\nsay: “You have been sued…” Read the documents to\nidentify who is suing you and how much they claim you\nowe. File a written answer before the deadline (answer\ndate). If you don’t file an answer or file it too late, the\ncreditor wins by default .\nWhat is an Answer?\nAn Answer is your first response to the lawsuit. Your\nanswer can be a handwritten letter to the court that says\nyou do not agree with the lawsuit. Include your case\n(cause) number and mailing address and any defenses\nyou may have to the lawsuit; for example, the amount they\n\nclaim you owe is incorrect, the account isn’t yours, or the\ndebt is older than 4 years.\nWhen is my answer date?\nThe citation will state when you must file an answer. In\nTexas county and district courts, the answer is due on the\nMonday following 20 days from when you’re served; in\nJustice Court, the answer is due 14 days from when you’re\nserved.\nDiscovery Requests\nThe creditor may have included “discovery requests” in\nthe form of Requests for Admissions, Interrogatories, or a\nRequest for Production asking you for documents. You\nhave 50 days to comply with these requests. If you do not\nanswer the Request for Admissions, you will automatically\nlose the lawsuit.\nAn attorney is not required for you to answer the lawsuit or\nsend discovery, but it’s a good idea to contact a lawyer if\nyou have defenses or claims against the creditor.\nWhat if I ignore the lawsuit?\nThe creditor wins by default, and can get a court judgment\nagainst you for the amount you owe and try to collect on\nthe judgment by seizing your property. By law, your\n\nhomestead and certain kinds of property and income are\nexempt. If everything you have is exempt, you may be\n“ judgment proof .” If you’re not judgment proof, you don’t\ndispute the amount, and the lawsuit was filed on time, try\nto negotiate a payment agreement with the creditor.\nCredit counseling can help with negotiations.

      "reference_material_content": "WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\nFact Sheet #30: Wage Garnishment Protections of the\nConsumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA)\nDecember 2024\nThis fact sheet provides general information concerning the CCPA’s limits on the amount that employers may withhold from a person’s\nearnings in response to a garnishment order, and the CCPA’s protection from termination because of garnishment for any single debt.\nWage Garnishments\nA wage garnishment is any legal or equitable procedure through which some portion of a person’s earnings is required to be withheld for the\npayment of a debt. Most garnishments are made by court order. Other types of legal or equitable procedures for garnishment include IRS or\nstate tax collection agency levies for unpaid taxes and federal agency administrative garnishments for non-tax debts owed to the federal\ngovernment.\nWage garnishments do not include voluntary wage assignments – that is, situations in which employees voluntarily agree that their\nemployers may turn over some specified amount of their earnings to a creditor or creditors.\nLimitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe CCPA limits the amount of an individual’s earnings that may be garnished and protects an employee from being fired if pay is garnished\nfor only one debt. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division administers the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, which\napply in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories and possessions. The wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA protect\neveryone who receives personal earnings.\nThe Wage and Hour Division has authority to enforce against employers the limits on the amount that may be garnished and the protections\nfrom termination because of garnishment for any single debt. Questions relating to other garnishment issues should be directed to the court\nor agency initiating the garnishment action. For example, questions regarding the priority given to certain garnishments over others are not\nmatters covered by the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA and may be referred to the court or agency initiating the action. The CCPA\ncontains no provisions controlling the priorities of garnishments, which are determined by state or other federal laws. However, in no event\nmay the amount of any individual’s disposable earnings that may be garnished exceed the percentages specified in the CCPA (see below for\nmore information).\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings that may be Garnished (General)\nThe amount of pay subject to garnishment is based on an employee’s “disposable earnings,” which is the amount of earnings left after\nlegally required deductions are made. Examples of such deductions include federal, state, and local taxes, and the employee’s share of\nSocial Security, Medicare and State Unemployment Insurance tax. It also includes withholdings for employee retirement systems required by\nlaw.\nDeductions not required by law – such as those for voluntary wage assignments, union dues, health and life insurance, contributions to\ncharitable causes, purchases of savings bonds, retirement plan contributions (except those required by law) and payments to employers for\npayroll advances or purchases of merchandise – usually may not be subtracted from gross earnings when calculating disposable earnings\nunder the CCPA.\n\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA set the maximum amount that may be garnished in any workweek or pay period, regardless of\nthe number of garnishment orders received by the employer. For ordinary garnishments (i.e., those not for support, bankruptcy, or any state\nor federal tax), the weekly amount may not exceed the lesser of two figures: 25% of the employee’s disposable earnings, or the amount by\nwhich an employee’s disposable earnings are greater than 30 times the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 an hour).\nTherefore, if the pay period is weekly and disposable earnings are $217.50 ($7.25 × 30) or less, there can be no garnishment. If disposable\nearnings are more than $217.50 but less than $290 ($7.25 × 40), the amount above $217.50 can be garnished. If disposable earnings are $290\nor more, a maximum of 25% can be garnished. When pay periods cover more than one week, multiples of the weekly restrictions must be\nused to calculate the maximum amounts that may be garnished. The table and examples at the end of this fact sheet illustrate these\namounts.\nMAXIMUM GARNISHMENT OF DISPOSABLE EARNINGS (GENERALLY) BASED ON CURRENT FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF $7.25 PER HOUR\nWeekly Biweekly Semimonthly Monthly\n$217.50 or less: $435.00 or less: $471.25 or less: $942.50 or less:\nNONE NONE NONE NONE\nMore than $217.50 but less More than $435.00 but less More than $471.25 but less than More than $942.50 but less than\nthan $290.00: than $580.00: $628.33: $1256.66:\nAmount ABOVE $217.50 Amount ABOVE $435.00 Amount ABOVE $471.25 Amount ABOVE $942.50\n$290.00 or more: $580.00 or more: $628.33 or more: $1256.66 or more:\nMAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25%\nAs discussed below, these limitations do not apply to certain bankruptcy court orders, or to garnishments to recover debts due for state or\nfederal taxes, and different limitations apply to garnishments pursuant to court orders for child support or alimony.\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings That May be Garnished for Child\nSupport and Alimony\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA also limit the amount of earnings that may be garnished pursuant to court orders for child\nsupport or alimony. The garnishment law allows up to 50% of a worker’s disposable earnings to be garnished for these purposes if the\nworker is supporting another spouse or child, or up to 60% if the worker is not. An additional 5% may be garnished for support payments\nmore than l2 weeks in arrears.\nDefinition of Earnings\nThe CCPA defines earnings as compensation paid or payable for personal services, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and\nperiodic payments from a pension or retirement program. Payments from an employment-based disability plan are also earnings.\nEarnings may include payments received in lump sums, including:\ncommissions;\ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary bonuses;\nproductivity or performance bonuses;\nprofit sharing;\nreferral and sign-on bonuses;\nmoving or relocation incentive payments;\nattendance, safety, and cash service awards;\n\nretroactive merit increases;\npayment for working during a holiday;\nworkers’ compensation payments for wage replacement, whether paid periodically or in a lump sum;\ntermination pay (e.g., payment of last wages, as well as any outstanding accrued benefits);\nseverance pay; and,\nback and front pay payments from insurance settlements.\nIn determining whether certain lump-sum payments are earnings under the CCPA, the central inquiry is whether the employer paid the\namount in question for the employee’s services. If the lump-sum payment is made in exchange for personal services rendered, then like\npayments received periodically, it will be subject to the CCPA’s garnishment limitations. Conversely, lump-sum payments that are unrelated\nto personal services rendered are not earnings under the CCPA. Similarly, payments and reimbursements to employees pursuant to an\nemployer-provided educational assistance program under IRS Code 127 do not constitute earnings for purposes of the CCPA’s limitations on\nwage garnishment.\nFor employees who receive tips, the cash wages paid directly by the employer and the amount of any tip credit claimed by the employer\nunder federal or state law are earnings for the purposes of the wage garnishment law. Tips received in excess of the tip credit amount or in\nexcess of the wages paid directly by the employer (if no tip credit is claimed or allowed) are not earnings for purposes of the CCPA.\nExceptions to Limitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe wage garnishment law specifies that its limitations on the amount of earnings that may be garnished do not apply to certain bankruptcy\ncourt orders, or to debts due for federal or state taxes.\nIf a state wage garnishment law differs from the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, the law resulting in the lower amount of earnings\nbeing garnished must be observed."

Fact-Checked\nWashington bankruptcy exemptions protect your property when filing for bankruptcy, and becoming familiar with them before filing can help you\ndetermine whether your assets are at risk. If you have more questions, read How to File Bankruptcy in Washington State. You'll find answers, helpful\nchecklists, and an interactive bankruptcy quiz link.\nIn This Article\nHow Do Bankruptcy Exemptions Work?\n“Creditors receive bankruptcy funds when a bankruptcy filer owns \"nonexempt\" property not covered by a\nbankruptcy exemption.”\nBankruptcy helps struggling people get back on their feet by lessening their debt burden, not stripping them of everything they own. Exemptions\nallow bankruptcy filers to keep things needed to maintain a home and employment. To determine whether your property is protected under\nexemption laws, you'll compare your property to the available laws. Most filers must use state exemption laws, but some states allow filers to use the\nfederal exemption laws instead.\nHowever, paying creditors is also an important consideration. Bankruptcy exemptions balance these interests by letting filers keep necessary\nproperty but not unnecessary luxury items.\nCreditors receive bankruptcy funds when a bankruptcy filer owns \"nonexempt\" property not covered by a bankruptcy exemption. In Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, the trustee responsible for the case sells the nonexempt property and pays creditors with the proceeds. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, filers\nmust pay an amount equal to the nonexempt portion through the Chapter 13 repayment plan, which the trustee forwards to creditors. (You'll find a\nmore extensive explanation of Chapters 7 and 13 below under the heading \"What Are the Differences Between Chapters 7 and 13 Bankruptcy?\")\nExample. When Maria filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, she had $5,000 in her checking account. In her bankruptcy petition, she listed her state's $500\ncash exemption and gave the nonexempt $4,500 to the bankruptcy trustee.\nExample. Harold owned an RV worth $25,000 when he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His state's exemption statutes didn't protect RVs, so he\nwas required to pay the value of the RV to creditors as part of his monthly Chapter 13 payment.\nNot Sure What to Expect in Bankruptcy?\n• Explore what bankruptcy can do for you.\n• Learn what to avoid doing before bankruptcy.\n• Discover the differences between Chapters 7 and 13.\nFor more targeted information, try our 10-question bankruptcy quiz. It can help identify bankruptcy issues that are best handled by a bankruptcy\nlawyer.\nWill Washington Bankruptcy Exemptions Protect My Property?\nYes, but you have two choices in Washington. You can use Washington state exemptions and federal nonbankruptcy exemptions. Or you can use\nfederal bankruptcy exemptions. You'll find both lists below. In many cases, married filers can double the exemption amount when filing together when\nthey both own the property. Check with a local bankruptcy lawyer for specifics.\nWhat Are the Washington Bankruptcy Exemptions?\nCaution: The state exemptions are not being updated in real time and should not be relied upon; they should only be used as a general guide. Some\nstate exemption amounts could be higher, and your state may have changed the law by adding new exemptions or deleting old ones. You must verify\nexemption availability through independent research or by consulting a local bankruptcy attorney.\n\nHomestead Exemption\nA homestead exemption helps you keep your residential house after bankruptcy. The Washington homestead exemption is much more generous\nthan the federal homestead exemption. Washington's homestead exemption amount is the greater of $125,000 or the previous year's median\nproperty value for the county where the property is located, which changes yearly. For instance, the 2024 median property value amounts range from\n$485,000 (across most of the state) to $823,000 (check with a local bankruptcy lawyer). Washington Center for Real Estate Research publishes the\nexemptable property values.\nYou can use the homestead exemption to protect personal property used as a residence, such as a mobile home, but the exemption amount is\nreduced significantly. Spouses can't double Washington's homestead exemption. (RCW §§ 6.13.010, 6.13.020, 6.13.030.) Learn more about\nprotecting your home in bankruptcy.\nMotor Vehicle Exemption\nA motor vehicle exemption helps you maintain transportation after bankruptcy. A filer can exempt the equity in one motor vehicle up to $15,000 in\nvalue using Washington's motor vehicle exemption. Spouses filing jointly can each exempt a vehicle. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(d)(iii).) Find out other\nrequirements you'll need to meet to protect a car in bankruptcy.\nWildcard Exemption\nA filer can exempt up to $10,000 worth of personal property, with some exceptions, using Washington's wildcard exemption. For instance, the\namount you can protect in cash and bank accounts is limited to $2,000 for people with consumer debts and $2,500 for filers with student loans.\n(RCW § 6.15.010(1)(d)(ii).)\nTools of the Trade Exemption\n• A debtor can exempt up to $15,000 in tools, instruments, and materials used to carry on his or her trade. Special exemptions are available\nfor farmers, physicians, attorneys, and clergymen. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(e)(i)-(iii).)\nPersonal Property Exemptions\n• Clothing. All clothing, except for no more than $3,500 for furs, jewelry, and personal ornaments per person (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(a)).\n• Family pictures and keepsakes. Books and electronic media to $3,500 per person (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(b).)\n• Cell phone, personal computer, and printer. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(c).)\n• Household goods, furniture, and provisions. Not to exceed $6,500 per individual or $13,000 per married couple, with no single item to\nexceed $750 (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(d)(i).)\n• Child support. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(d)(iv).)\n• Professionally prescribed health aids. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(d)(v).)\n• Personal injury recovery. Not to exceed $20,000 per individual or loss of future income payments to the extent reasonably necessary. (RCW\n§ 6.15.010(1)(d)(vi).)\n• Tuition units. Must be purchased more than two years before filing. (RCW § 6.15.010(1)(f).)\n• Annuities. (RCW § 6.15.020(1).)\nOther Exemptions\n• Fire insurance proceeds from exempt property. (RCW § 6.15.030.)\n• Some separate property of a spouse. (RCW §§ 6.15.040, 26.16.200.)\n• Wages, salaries, and personal services compensation. (RCW § 6.27.150.)\n• Trust income. (RCW § 6.32.250.)\n• Crime victim compensation. (RCW §§ 7.68.070, 51.32.040.)\n• Some partnership property. (RCW § 25.04.250.)\n• Uniforms and firearms. (RCW § 38.40.150.)\n• Police and fire retirement.\n• Disability benefits. (RCW § 48.18.400.)\n• Individual and group life insurance proceeds. (RCW §§ 48.18.410-420.)\n• Annuity contract benefits. Up to $3,000 per month. (RCW § 48.18.430.)\n• Fraternal benefit society benefits. (RCW § 48.36A.180.)\n• Burial lots. Must be sold by a nonprofit association. (RCW §§ 68.20.120, 68.24.220.)\n• Work release earnings. (RCW § 72.65.060.)\n• Public assistance. (RCW §§ 74.04.280, 74.08.210, 40.020, 51.32.040)\nPension and Retirement Exemptions\n• Police and firefighter retirement benefits are exempt. (RCW §§ 41.26.053, 41.20.180, 41.24.240, 43.43.310.)\n• Retirement benefits of teachers are exempt. (RCW §§ 41.32.590, 41.32.052, 41.32.055.)\n• City employee retirement benefits are exempt. (RCW §§ 41.44.240, 41.28.200.)\n• A debtor may exempt federal pension benefits except for child support, and retirement disability benefits except for alimony and child\nsupport. (RCW §§ 6.15.020(2), (3).)\n• Most tax-exempt pensions and retirement accounts are exempt because federal law lets filers keep tax-exempt retirement accounts in\nbankruptcy. These retirement accounts include 401(K)s, 403(b)s, profit-sharing and money purchase plans, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs, and\ntraditional and Roth IRAs to $1,711,975 per person for cases filed between April 1, 2025, and March 31, 2028. (11 USC §§ 522(b)(3)(C);\n(n); current amounts are posted in the Federal Register.)\nYou can check with your fund to determine if it qualifies for tax-exempt status."

      "reference_material_content": "Here's how you know\nQualified business income\ndeduction\nMany owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations and\nsome trusts and estates may be eligible for a qualified business income\n(QBI) deduction – also called the Section 199A deduction – for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017. The deduction allows eligible\ntaxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of their QBI, plus 20 percent of\nqualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified\npublicly traded partnership (PTP) income. Income earned through a C\ncorporation or by providing services as an employee is not eligible for\nthe deduction. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or\nbusiness, see Determining your qualified trades or businesses in the\nInstructions for Form 8995-A or Form 8995.\nThe deduction is available regardless of whether taxpayers itemize\ndeductions on Schedule A or take the standard deduction. Eligible\ntaxpayers can claim the deduction for tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017, and ending on or before December 31, 2025.\n\nThe deduction has two components.\n1. QBI component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of QBI from a domestic business operated as a sole\nproprietorship or through a partnership, S corporation, trust, or\nestate. The QBI Component is subject to limitations, depending on\nthe taxpayer's taxable income which may include the type of trade\nor business, the amount of W-2 wages paid by the qualified trade or\nbusiness, and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition\n(UBIA) of qualified property held by the trade or business. It may\nalso be reduced by the patron reduction if the taxpayer is a patron\nof an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.\n2. REIT/PTP component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income. This\ncomponent is not limited by W-2 wages or the UBIA of qualified\nproperty. Depending on the taxpayer's taxable income, the amount\nof PTP income that qualifies may be limited depending on the type\nof the PTP's trade or business.\nThe deduction is limited to the lesser of the QBI component plus the\nREIT/PTP component or 20 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income\nminus net capital gain.\nQBI is the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction,\nand loss from any qualified trade or business, including income from\npartnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships, and certain trusts.\nGenerally, this includes, but is not limited to, the deductible part of\n\nself-employment tax, self-employed health insurance, and deductions\nfor contributions to qualified retirement plans (e.g., SEP, SIMPLE and\nqualified plan deductions).\nQBI does not include items such as:\nItems that are not properly includable in taxable income\nInvestment items such as capital gains or losses\nInterest income not properly allocable to a trade or business\nWage income\nIncome that is not effectively connected with the conduct of\nbusiness within the United States\nCommodities transactions or foreign currency gains or losses\nCertain dividends and payments in lieu of dividends\nIncome, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts\nAnnuities, unless received in connection with the trade or business\nAmounts received as reasonable compensation from an S\ncorporation\nAmounts received as guaranteed payments from a partnership\nPayments received by a partner for services other than in a capacity\nas a partner\nQualified REIT dividends\nPTP income\nSolely for the purposes of section 199A, a safe harbor is available to\nindividuals and owners of passthrough entities who seek to claim the\ndeduction under section 199A with respect to a rental real estate\nenterprise. Under the safe harbor a rental real estate enterprise will be\n\ntreated as a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction if\ncertain criteria are met. For more information on the safe harbor,\nsee News Release IR-2019-158\nAn interest in rental real estate that does not meet the requirements of\nthe safe harbor may still be treated as a trade or business for purposes\nof the QBI deduction if it otherwise is a section 162 trade or business.\nIn addition, the rental or licensing of tangible or intangible property\nthat does not rise to the level of a section 162 trade or business is\nnevertheless treated as a qualified trade or business for purposes of\nsection 199A if the rental or licensing of property is to a commonly\ncontrolled trade or business operated by the individual or a\npassthrough entity as provided in Treas.

      "reference_material_content": "Here's how you know\nAdoption Credit\nIf you adopt an eligible child, you may be able to claim the Adoption\nCredit or income exclusion for employer-provided adoption benefits.\nQualified adoption expenses are limited to $17,280 per qualifying child\nfor 2025. The credit and the exclusion apply to international, domestic,\nprivate or public foster care adoptions.\nBeginning in tax year 2025, a portion of the Adoption Credit is\nrefundable up to $5,000. The non-refundable portion of the credit can\nbe carried forward for a maximum of 5 years; however, it cannot result\nin a refund. Any remaining non-refundable portion after 5 years is\nforfeited.\nOn this page\nWho’s eligible\nQualified expenses\nExclude expenses from income\nRules for children with special needs\nWhen to claim\n\nFigure the credit\nClaim the credit\nAmend an incorrect return\nEligibility\nYou are eligible for the Adoption Credit if you meet these criteria:\nYour modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) was $259,190 or less in\n2025. The credit is available but reduced if your MAGI was between\n$259,191 and $299,189. The credit is unavailable if your MAGI was\n$299,190 or more.\nIf married, you must file jointly to claim the credit. Exceptions exist\nfor married filing separately, and you can amend past returns to\nchange your filing status if needed.\nYou may qualify if you're a registered domestic partner in a State\nthat allows second-parent adoption. However, you cannot claim\nthe credit for expenses related to adopting your spouse’s child.\nA “qualified child” for the Adoption Credit must be:\nUnder age 18, or\nPhysically or mentally incapable of self-care.\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see whether you qualify to claim\nthe Adoption Credit.\nQualified expenses\nQualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary expenses\nyou paid to adopt, including:\n\nAdoption fees\nAttorney fees\nCourt costs\nTravel expenses (including meals and lodging) while away from\nhome\nOther expenses directly related to, or for the principal purpose of,\nthe legal adoption\nExpenses paid before identifying an eligible child, such as home\nstudy fees\nExpenses that don’t qualify for the credit\nExpenses aren’t eligible if they are:\nTo adopt your spouse’s child\nFor a surrogate parent arrangement\nAllowed for another federal tax credit or deduction\nPaid by a Federal, State or local program\nReimbursed by your employer\nExclude expenses from income\nIf your employer provides adoption benefits for qualified expenses, you\nmay not have to include those benefits in your income, which means\nyou may not have to pay taxes on them. You can exclude up to $17,280\nfrom your income in 2025 if your employer paid you those benefits:\nUnder a written qualified adoption assistance program\nDirectly or through a third party\n\nYou can find these payments on your Form W-2, Box 12, Code T, or your\nsalary may have been reduced to pay these benefits.\nSubtract this employer-provided benefit from your income before you\ncalculate the adoption tax credit. See Employer-Provided Adoption\nBenefits for more information.\nRules for children with special needs\nBeginning in 2025, Indian tribal governments have the same authority\nas State governments to determine whether a child has special needs\nfor the purpose of claiming the Adoption Credit.\nFor special needs adoptions, a child qualifies if they:\nAre a U.S. citizen, and\nA state or Indian tribal government has determined the child:\nCan't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home, and\nIs not likely to be adopted without assistance to the adoptive\nfamily.\nAcceptable documentation of the state or Indian tribal government’s\ndetermination of special needs includes, but is not limited to:\nAn adoption assistance or subsidy agreement issued by the state,\ntribal court or tribal government representative\nCertification from the state, county or tribal welfare agency, or\ntribal government verifying that the child is approved to receive\nadoption assistance\nCertification from the state, county, or tribal welfare agency, or\ntribal government verifying that the child has special needs\n\nAn official letter on state, county, or tribal government letterhead\nconfirming the special needs determination\nFind examples of State and Indian tribal government determinations\nfor special needs in the Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption\nExpenses.\nIf you adopt a child with special needs, you may be able to claim:\nThe full income exclusion, even if your employer didn’t pay\nexpenses (if your employer has a written qualified adoption\nassistance program)\nThe full credit even if you didn't pay any qualified adoption\nexpenses\nWhen to claim the credit\nDomestic adoptions: Claim expenses each year as you incur or pay\nthem as long as the adoption is finalized. Claim expense the year\nafter you incur or pay them if the adoption is still in progress and\nnot final. If the child is a U.S. citizen or resident, you may claim the\ncredit even if the adoption is unsuccessful.\nForeign adoptions: Claim expenses once the adoption is final. When\nit’s final, you can claim all eligible expenses you paid, including in\npast years.\nAdoption of children deemed by a state or Indian tribal government\nwelfare agency as special needs or hard to place: Claim expenses\nwhen the adoption is final.\n\nFind examples of these timing rules to claim the credit in\nthe Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses.\nFigure the credit and exclusion amounts\nThe credit amount applies to the adoption of each child\nindividually, not each calendar year. If you claim expenses in more\nthan one year for the same adoption (final or in progress), you must\nsubtract past credit amounts you claimed from your remaining credit.\nExample: You claimed a $3,000 Adoption Credit in 2024 for expenses\nincurred in 2023 for the adoption of a child that was not finalized\nduring that year. In 2025, you paid $17,280 for additional expenses\nrelated to the adoption of the same child, which was finalized during\nthe year. Since you are claiming expenses related to the adoption of\nthe same child and have already claimed a $3,000 Adoption Credit in\npast years, you can only claim a credit of $14,280 in 2025 ($17,280 less\nthe $3,000 credit you previously claimed).\nThe income exclusion is in addition to the credit, but you can’t\nclaim both for the same expenses. You must claim any allowable\nexclusion before claiming any allowable credit. To do this, complete\nPart III of Form 8839 before you complete Part II.\nExample: In 2025, you paid $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses, and\nyour employer reimbursed you for $4,000. You can exclude $4,000 from\nyour income. Your maximum credit is $6,000 ($10,000 less the $4,000\nemployer reimbursement).\n\nIf you adopt a child deemed to be special needs (previously defined),\nyou may be able to take the income exclusion even if your employer\ndidn’t pay qualified expenses.\nClaim the credit\nTo claim the Adoption Credit or exclusion:\nComplete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, and attach the\nform to your tax return.\nReport the required information about the eligible child on Form\n8839, Part I. The child’s identifying number can be their Social\nSecurity number, adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN) or\nindividual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Use Form W-7A\nPDF , Application for Adoption Tax Identification Number for\nPending U.S. Adoptions (Instructions PDF ), to receive an\nATIN. Note: See Instructions for Form 8839 if you can’t give\ncomplete information about an eligible child you tried to adopt in\nprior years because the adoption was either unsuccessful or wasn’t\nfinal by the end of 2025.\nKeep the adoption documentation for your records.\nAmend an incorrect return\nIf you claimed an incorrect credit amount, file an amended return. You\ncan check the status of an amended return around 3 weeks after you\nsubmit it. You should generally allow 8 to 12 weeks for your Form 1040-\nX to be processed.\n\nIf you claimed the credit and we reject or reduce it, you can consider\nappealing it.\nRelated\nForm 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses\nInstructions for Form 8839\nAdoption Taxpayer Identification Number\nPublication 5851, New Parents Check eligibility for these tax credits\nand deductions PDF\nPublication 6123, Adoption Tax Credit Checklist PDF\nPublication 6124, 5 Things to Know About the Adoption Tax Credit\nPDF\nPage Last Reviewed or Updated: 05-Jan-\n2026"

      "reference_material_content": "Here's how you know\nSelf-employment tax\n(Social Security and\nMedicare taxes)\nIn the article below, all references to self-employment tax refer to\nSocial Security and Medicare taxes only and do not include any other\ntaxes that self-employed individuals may be required to pay. The list of\nitems below is not all-inclusive. Other information may be appropriate\nfor your specific type of business.\nWhat is self-employment tax?\nWho must pay self-employment tax?\nHow do I pay self-employment tax?\n\nWhat is self-employment tax?\nSelf-employment tax is a tax consisting of Social Security and Medicare\ntaxes primarily for individuals who work for themselves. It is similar to\nthe Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from the pay of most\nwage earners.\nEmployers calculate Social Security and Medicare taxes for most wage\nearners. However, you calculate self-employment tax (SE tax) using\nSchedule SE, Self-Employment Tax, (Form 1040 PDF or 1040-SR). Also,\nyou can deduct the employer-equivalent portion of your SE tax when\ncalculating your adjusted gross income. Wage earners cannot deduct\nSocial Security and Medicare taxes.\nSelf-employment tax rate\nThe self-employment tax rate is 15.3%. The rate consists of two parts:\n12.4% for social security (old-age, survivors, and disability insurance)\nand 2.9% for Medicare (hospital insurance).\nFor 2024, the first $168,600 of your combined wages, tips, and net\nearnings is subject to any combination of the social security part of\nself-employment tax, social security tax, or railroad retirement (tier 1)\ntax. (Refer to Schedule SE for prior year(s) SE tax rates).\nIf your wages and tips are subject to social security tax or railroad\nretirement tier 1 tax, and total at least $168,600, do not pay the 12.4%\nsocial security part of the SE tax on any of your net earnings. However,\nall of your wages and tips are subject to the 2.9% Medicare part of the\nSE tax on all your net earnings.\n\nYou are liable for an additional 0.9% Medicare Tax if your wages,\ncompensation, or self-employment income (together with that of your\nspouse if filing a joint return) exceed the threshold amount for your\nfiling status:\nThreshold\nFiling status amount\nMarried filing jointly $250,000\nMarried filing separate $125,000\nSingle $200,000\nHead of household (with qualifying person) $200,000\nQualifying surviving spouse with dependent $200,000\nchild\nFor more information, refer to the Questions and answers for the\nadditional Medicare tax page.\nIf you use a tax year other than the calendar year, you must use the tax\nrate and maximum earnings limit in effect at the beginning of your tax\nyear. Even if the tax rate or maximum earnings limit changes during\nyour tax year, continue to use the same rate and limit throughout your\ntax year.\n\nSelf-employment tax deduction\nYou can deduct the employer-equivalent portion of your self-\nemployment tax in figuring your adjusted gross income. This deduction\nonly affects your income tax. It does not affect either your net earnings\nfrom self-employment or your self-employment tax.\nIf you file Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return, or Form 1040-SR,\nU.S. Income Tax Return for Seniors, with Schedule C, Profit or Loss from\nBusiness, you may be eligible to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit\n(EITC). Learn more about EITC or use the EITC Assistant to find out if\nyou are eligible.\nSelf-employment health insurance tax deduction\nUnder Section 2042 of the Small Business Jobs Act, a deduction, for\nincome tax purposes, is allowed to self-employed individuals for the\ncost of health insurance. This deduction is taken into account when\ncalculating net earnings from self-employment. See Instructions for\nForm 1040 and Form 1040-SR PDF and Instructions for Schedule SE\nPDF for calculating and claiming the deduction.\nWho must pay self-employment tax?\nYou must pay self-employment tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040 or\nForm 1040-SR) if either of the following applies.\nYour net earnings from self-employment (excluding church\nemployee income) were $400 or more.\nYou had church employee income of $108.28 or more.\n\nGenerally, your net earnings from self-employment are subject to self-\nemployment tax. If you are self-employed as a sole proprietor or\nindependent contractor, you generally use Schedule C to figure net\nearnings from self-employment.\nIf you have earnings subject to self-employment tax, use Schedule SE\nto figure your net earnings from self-employment. Before you figure\nyour net earnings, you generally need to figure your total earnings\nsubject to self-employment tax.\nNote: The self-employment tax rules apply no matter how old you are\nand even if you are already receiving Social Security or Medicare.\nFamily caregivers and self-employment tax\nSpecial rules apply to workers who perform in-home services for\nelderly or disabled individuals (caregivers). Caregivers are typically\nemployees of the individuals for whom they provide services because\nthey work in the homes of the elderly or disabled individuals and these\nindividuals have the right to tell the caregivers what needs to be done.\nSee the Family caregivers and self-employment tax page and\nPublication 926, Household Employer’s Tax Guide, for more details.\nHow do I pay self-employment tax?\nTo pay self-employment tax, you must have a Social Security number\n(SSN) or an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).\n\nObtaining a Social Security number\nIf you never had an SSN, apply for one using Form SS-5, Application for\na Social Security Card. You can get this form at any Social Security\noffice or by calling 800-772-1213. Download the form from the Social\n\nSecurity number and card website.\nObtaining an individual taxpayer identification number\nThe IRS will issue you an ITIN if you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN. To apply for an\nITIN, file Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Number PDF .\nPaying self-employment tax with estimated taxes\nAs a self-employed individual, you may have to file Estimated Taxes\nquarterly. You can use these estimated tax payments to pay your self-\nemployment tax. Refer to the Estimated taxes page and Publication\n505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax for more details on paying\nyour self-employment tax with estimated taxes.\nRelated\nBusiness taxes\nEstimated taxes\nOnline Tax Calendar\nFICA tip credit\n\nPage Last Reviewed or Updated: 09-Nov-\n2025"

You can get a maximum annual credit of $2,500 per\neligible student. If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to zero,\nyou can have 40 percent of any remaining amount of the credit (up to\n$1,000) refunded to you.\nThe amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified\neducation expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent\nof the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that\nstudent.\nWho is an eligible student for AOTC?\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see if you’re eligible to claim an\neducation credit.\n\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the student must:\nBe pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential in a\npost-secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a\n\nUS Department of Education student aid program.\nBe enrolled at least half-time for at least 1 academic period*\nbeginning in the tax year\nNot have finished the first 4 years of higher education at the\nbeginning of the tax year\nNot have claimed AOTC or the former Hope Credit for more than 4\ntax years; AOTC years do not have to be consecutive but do include\nyears the Hope credit was claimed for the same student\nNot have a felony drug conviction at the end of the tax year\n*Academic period can be semesters, trimesters, quarters or any other\nperiod of study such as a summer school session. Schools determine\nacademic periods. For schools that use clock or credit hours and don’t\nhave academic terms, the payment period may be treated as an\nacademic period.\nCourses can be online.\nClaiming the credit\nTo claim AOTC, you must complete the Form 8863 and attach the\ncompleted form to your tax return.\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the law requires the student to have received\nForm 1098-T, Tuition Statement, from an eligible educational\ninstitution, domestic or foreign. Generally, students get the form from\ntheir school by Jan. 31.\n\nIf you received a Form 1098-T, this statement will help you figure your\ncredit. The form will have an amount in Box 1 to show the amounts\nreceived during the year. This amount may not be the amount you can\nclaim. For information on what amount to claim, see qualified\neducation expenses in Tax Benefits for Education, Pub. 970. Check the\nform to make sure it’s correct. If it isn’t correct or you don’t receive the\nform but should, contact the institution.\nIf you didn’t receive Form 1098-T, you may still be eligible to claim a\ncredit. The institution isn't required to furnish Form 1098-T if the\nstudent:\nIs a qualified nonresident alien\nHas qualified education expenses paid entirely with scholarships or\nunder a formal billing arrangement\nIs enrolled in courses for which no academic credit is awarded\nTo claim a credit without it if you otherwise qualify, show that the\nstudent was enrolled at an eligible institution and substantiate the\npayment of the qualified tuition and related expenses.\nBe careful claiming AOTC\nMake sure you’re qualified before claiming the credit. Keep copies of all\ndocuments you used to find out if you qualify and determine the credit\namount.\nIf we audit your return and find your claim is incorrect and you don’t\nhave the documents to show you qualified, you:\n\nMust pay back the amount of the AOTC you received in error with\ninterest\nMay also be charged an accuracy or a fraud penalty\nCan be banned from claiming AOTC for 2 to 10 years\nIf your AOTC claim was disallowed in a previous tax year, you may need\nto file Form 8862 PDF before claiming the credit in future tax years.\nSee My credit was disallowed and now I want to claim it.\nGet TIN before return due date\nYou can only claim AOTC if you, your spouse (if filing jointly) and the\nqualifying student have a valid taxpayer identification number\n(TIN) issued or applied for on or before the return’s due date (including\nextensions).\nYou may not claim AOTC on a later original return or amended return if\nthe TIN is issued or applied for after the return’s due date (including\nextensions).\nAOTC income limits\nTo claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income\n(MAGI) must be $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for married filing\njointly).\nYou receive a reduced amount of the credit if your MAGI is over\n$80,000 but less than $90,000 (over $160,000 but less than $180,000\nfor married filing jointly).\nYou can’t claim the credit if your MAGI is over $90,000 ($180,000 for\njoint filers)."

      "reference_material_content": "What is the best way to pay off\ndebt? Debt Avalanche vs. Debt\nSnowball\nSarah Brady, NFCC July 1, 2024\n\nWhen you set your mind on a goal, you want to achieve it in\nthe best way possible. But what does “best” mean, exactly?\nSometimes it depends on the person.\nFor example, let’s say you’re training for a marathon.\nNaturally, your goal is to finish the race — and it’s an\nimpressive feat to run 26.2 miles! For others, the goal is to\nmake a certain time, break a personal record or finish in first\nplace.\nPaying off debt works the same way. The goal of being debt\nfree is a great objective for anyone, but there’s more than one\nway to do it. For people who struggle with motivation, the\nsnowball method is usually best. For people who want to\nsave money in interest charges, the avalanche method is the\nway to go.\nThe Debt Snowball vs. The\nDebt Avalanche\nIf you haven’t heard of the debt snowball or the debt\navalanche methods before, let us explain.\n\nThese are two different strategies for paying off credit cards\nand some other types of debt. Both are considered do-it-\nyourself (DIY) methods, because you can follow them on\nyour own, without any outside help. Here’s how they work.\nHow the Debt Avalanche Works\nThe debt avalanche is a strategy in which you prioritize\npaying off debt based on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\n— starting from highest rate to lowest. This can also be\nreferred to as the“stacking method” or the “debt ladder.”\nTo be clear, when using this method, you still make the\nminimum monthly payments on all of your debts, but you put\nyour extra money toward the debt with the highest APR (a\nnumber that represents your interest rate and fees).\nOnce the first debt is paid off, you continue this method by\npaying off the account with the next highest interest rate.\nFollow this pattern until you’re debt free.\nIf that sounds simple, it is. It’s not a magic formula for\nerasing debt, but it does help you focus on a goal and save\nmoney while becoming debt free. Just make sure you avoid\ntaking on new debt while using this method, or it will take\nyou longer to reach your goal.\n\nHow the Debt Snowball Works\nThe debt snowball method is a payment strategy in which\nyou pay off debts in order of the balances you owe — from\nsmallest to largest.\nJust like a snowball starts small and gets bigger as it rolls,\nyou start with the smallest debt and work your way up. Of\ncourse, you continue to make your debt payments, but you\npay just the minimum monthly payments on most accounts\nand put all your extra cash toward the account with the\nsmallest balance. Repeat this process until all debts are\npaid.\nAs you pay off accounts, you eliminate monthly payments,\nfreeing up even more money to put toward your next\nsmallest debt. In other words, this method is all about\nmomentum and seeing progress as quickly as possible.\nTo recap, here’s how the two methods compare:\nDebt Avalanche Debt Snowball\nPriority Highest APR Lowest balance\nSave money on Pay off individual\ninterest accounts faster\nBenefits Shorter timeframe More motivation to\nto pay off all debt stick with your plan\n\nDebt Avalanche Debt Snowball\nPriority Highest APR Lowest balance\nDrawback Less motivating More expensive\nChoosing the Best Method\nfor You\nIf you’re making a plan to pay off debt and you need to\nchoose which method to use, consider these details first.\nYour financial personality\nThink about how each repayment option aligns with your\nfinancial personality, meaning your attitudes, habits,\nstrengths and challenges when it comes to money.\nIf you’re someone who’s motivated by efficiency and\nembraces savings over spontaneity, then the debt avalanche\nmethod may be the perfect fit. You’re more likely to stay\ncommitted to the plan, even if it takes longer to pay off\nindividual accounts.\nOn the other hand, if you like to see quick results and you\nstruggle with reaching financial goals, the debt snowball is\nideal. You won’t mind the fact that repayment is slightly more\n\nexpensive, because it’s worth the joy of seeing account\nbalances hit $0 as quickly as possible.\nThe amounts you owe\nBefore you make a plan, be sure to take an inventory of your\ndebt. Write down how much you owe one each account,\nalong with the interest rate.\nDo you owe similar amounts on each account? If so, choose\nthe debt avalanche, since it could actually help you pay off\naccounts sooner and save you money. If you have a wide\nrange of balances, the snowball can still make sense.\nStudent loan debt\nEach type of debt has different repayment options, and those\noptions can impact your payment strategy. For example,\nfederal student loans give you far more repayment options\nthan private student loans.\nFor federal loans, the Department of Education (ED) offers\nIncome-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans with payments as low\nas $0 a month. Plus, the ED has debt forgiveness programs\n\nand can pause your payments if you’re facing a financial\nhardship.\nBy contrast, private student loan lenders are not required to\noffer any help to students. In other words, it’s worth checking\nto see what you qualify for before sending extra money to\nyour federal student loan servicer.\nLow APR\nOnce you eliminate your high-APR debt — meaning debt with\nrates of 8% or higher — you’ll want to change your approach.\nLower interest debt usually includes accounts that are\n“secured” by collateral, such as mortgages and home equity\nloans. You can often get a better payoff by making the\nminimum payments on these accounts, and putting your\nextra cash into a low-risk investment such as a retirement\naccount (especially one with an employer match) or a\nmutual fund.\nEliminate debt for good\nAs you can see, the “best” way to pay off debt depends on\nyour situation. The most important thing is to stay\ncommitted to eliminating debt with whichever plan you\nchoose, whether it’s the debt avalanche or the debt snowball\nmethod."

Companies that design credit scores each use their own\ncomplicated mathematical formulas, called scoring models, to create your credit\nscore from the information in your credit report. Factors that make up a typical\ncredit score include the number and type of loan accounts you have, whether you\nmake your payments on time, and your current unpaid debt.\nCompanies use credit scores to make decisions such as whether to offer a person\na mortgage, credit card, auto loan, or other credit product. Credit scores are also\nused to determine the interest rate a person receives on a loan or credit card, as\nwell as the credit limit they’re offered.\nWho collects my credit history?\nCompanies collect consumers’ financial and credit information from businesses\nthat furnish it to them. This may include not only information about loans and credit\ncards, but also things like payment history for rent and utilities. Multiple companies\ncalculate and sell credit scores. Thus, you may have more than one credit score,\nand the scores may be different from one another. Credit scores may vary as a\nresult of differing scoring models used or information gathered to calculate the\nscores. Banks, credit unions, credit card companies, and lenders may use credit\nscores from a range of credit reporting companies.\nWhat do credit scores represent?\nCredit scores provide a snapshot of a person’s financial situation. They provide a\nway for lenders to determine whether they will lend to you or under what terms they\nwill lend to you. A higher credit score means you are predicted to be less of a risk.\nUsually a high credit score makes it easier to get a loan and may result in a better\ninterest rate, but lenders have their own cutoffs to determine eligibility. Most credit\nscores range from 300 to 850.\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 1 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\nFICO (calculated using scoring models designed by Fair Isaac Corporation) and\nVantageScore (calculated using scoring models designed by VantageScore\nSolutions) are two of the most commonly used credit scores.\nView two different ranges of credit scores:\nFICO credit scores\nVantageScore 3.0\nHow are credit scores calculated?\nCredit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit report. Even\nthough different credit scores have different mathematical formulas, they all use\nthe information from your credit report. So, while some pieces of information in\nyour credit reports may be weighted somewhat differently depending on who\nis calculating your score, the key is to understand the information in your credit\nreports. A good rule to live by is to check your credit reports every year through\nannualcreditreport.com and fix any errors.\nWhile detailed information about the way that FICO and VantageScore (and other\ncredit score companies) calculate their scores is not public, these companies\nprovide a general sense of what goes into a credit score.\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 2 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\nView two credit scoring models:\nFICO model\nLength of credit\nhistory (15%)\nTypes of credit used (10%) Payment history (35%)\nLength of credit\nhistory (15%)\nTypes of credit used (10%) Payment history (35%)\nNew credit history Total debt (30%)\n(10%)\nNew credit history Total debt (30%)\nRecent credit Utilization Payment history\n(10%)\n(5%) (20%) (40%)\nVantageScore model\nRecent credit Utilization Payment history\n(5%) (20%) (40%)\nAvailable Depth of credit\ncredit (3%) (21%)\nBalances (11%)\nAvailable Depth of credit\ncredit (3%) (21%)\nBalances (11%)\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 3 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\n§ Payment history tracks whether you are paying your bills on time and as agreed.\n§ Total debt, balances, and utilization look at both total owed as well as how\nmuch available credit a person is using.\n§ Depth/length of credit history reflects how long you have had relationships with\na creditor(s); the longer your credit history with a lender, the more likely your\ncredit score will increase in this category.\n§ New/recent credit considers all new loans or accounts and includes how many\ntimes creditors have requested a person’s credit report, which could be an\nindicator of risk.\n§ Types of credit used refers to a person’s credit mix, which includes both\ncredit cards (known as revolving credit) and loans (which can be considered\ninstallment credit).\n\nTip\nThe way you use and repay debt affects your credit score. So, remember\nthat your score can be helpful in tracking and improving your credit use and\nbehavior. Paying loans on time and staying well below your credit limit helps\nyou get and keep good credit.\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 4 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022"

It measures how much pressure debt is putting on your budget, which helps you\ndecide if you can handle more debt.\nFor example, if you have a debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent, then 36 cents of every\ndollar earned is going to pay for debt, leaving you 64 cents to pay for everything else.\nA high debt-to-income ratio could affect your ability to get additional credit because\ncreditors may be concerned that you won’t be able to handle their debt on top of what\nyou already owe.\nYou can also use the debt-to-income ratio as a benchmark for reducing your debt—as your\ndebt decreases, so will your debt-to-income ratio. This means money is being freed up to\nuse on other things like saving, expenses, and emergencies.\nWhat to do\n•\nComplete the \"Debt log” to figure out your total monthly debt payment. If you\nhave court-ordered fixed payments, such as child support, count these as debt for\nthis purpose.\n•\nFigure out your gross monthly income (before taxes or insurance). This includes\nmoney earned from a job or child support payments you may receive. If your income\nvaries from month to month, estimate your income on a typical month (it’s better to\nestimate lower for the purposes of this tool).\nA step further\nIf your debt-to-income ratio is above the guidelines, use the “Debt action plan” to help\nreduce your debt and lower your debt-to-income ratio.\n1\n\nThe Debt-to-income calculator gives\nyou a benchmark for planning.\n1. Enter your total monthly debt payment on the first line of the equation. You can copy it from\nthe \"Debt log.\"\n2. Enter your gross monthly income on the second line. If your income varies from month to month,\nestimate what you receive in a typical month.\n3.

A soft inquiry happens\nwhen you or someone else checks your credit\nunrelated to a specific credit application.\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nWhat Is a Hard Credit Inquiry?\nWhat Is a Soft Credit Inquiry?\nHow to Minimize Credit Inquiries\nCan You Remove Hard Inquiries?\nInquiries are entries that appear on your credit report when your\ncredit information is accessed by a legally authorized person or\norganization (including yourself).\nCredit inquiries fall into two categories: hard inquiries and soft\ninquiries. While the two types of inquiries have some things in\ncommon, there are some key differences in their purposes and\ntheir impact on your credit.\n\nHard Inquiry vs. Soft Inquiry\nHard Inquiry Soft Inquiry\nCan temporarily lower your Doesn't affect your credit score\ncredit score\nTypically occurs when you apply May occur for a variety of reasons\nfor credit\nRequires your permission May not require your permission\nRemains on your credit reports Remains on your credit reports for\nfor two years up to two years\nWhat Is a Hard Credit Inquiry?\nA hard inquiry, also called a hard pull or hard credit check,\noccurs when a creditor accesses your credit file to assess your\ncreditworthiness and potentially approve you for a credit card,\nloan or line of credit. Depending on the lender and type of credit,\nthey may view one, two or all three of your credit reports from\nthe three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and\nEquifax).\nThe most common scenarios in which you can expect a hard\ninquiry include:\n\nApplying for a new credit card: Each credit card application\nwill likely result in a hard inquiry.\nPurchasing or leasing a car: Whether you're applying for a\nloan from a bank or dealership to buy a car or you're leasing\na car, you can expect a hard inquiry.\nBuying a house: When you apply for a mortgage, the lender\nwill do a hard pull on your credit initially, then again shortly\nbefore closing.\nApplying for a personal loan: As with other lenders,\npersonal loan lenders will do a hard credit pull when you\nformally apply for the loan.\nApplying for a private student loan: If you're applying for\nprivate student student loans, lenders will likely run a hard\ninquiry to evaluate your creditworthiness. The same is true\nif you apply for a federal direct PLUS loan, including parent\nPLUS loans.\nRequesting a credit line increase: If you ask your credit\ncard issuer to increase your credit limit, it may run a hard\ninquiry to determine your eligibility.\nRenting or leasing an apartment: This could be a hard pull\nor soft pull; check with the landlord or leasing company to\nknow for sure.\n\nHow Long Do Hard Inquiries Stay on\nYour Credit Report?\nHard inquiries remain on your credit report for up to two years,\nbut as long as you keep up with your debt payments, credit\nscores often rebound from an inquiry within a few months. Also,\nmost credit scoring models no longer count a hard inquiry in\nscore calculations at all after 12 months.\nAccording to FICO, one hard inquiry will typically reduce your\nscore by fewer than five points. However, multiple hard inquiries\nin a short period of time may have a compounding negative\neffect.\nThe only exception is if you're rate shopping for a mortgage\nloan, auto loan or student loan. In this event, FICO will ignore\nrate-shopping inquiries fewer than 30 days old and count\nmultiple inquiries as a single inquiry if they all occur within a\ncertain period—45 days for new FICO scoring models and 14\ndays for older models.\nWhat Is a Soft Credit Inquiry?\nSoft inquiries appear on your credit report when someone runs a\ncredit check for reasons unrelated to lending you money. A soft\npull or soft credit check can happen for several different\nreasons, including:\n\nChecking your own credit: Viewing your own credit report\ngenerates a soft inquiry.\nLoan prequalification: Some lenders may do a soft pull\nwhen you are seeking loan prequalification—and in some\ncases, preapproval—as part of the rate-shopping process.\nPromotional offers: A company may pull your credit to see\nif you qualify for a promotional offer. These are also called\npre-screened offers.\nEmployment background checks: Employers may perform\nsoft inquiries as part of their pre-employment screening\nprocess.\nRequesting utilities: When you apply to set up a service at a\nnew address, the utility companies might check your credit\nto determine whether you need to make a deposit.\nRenting or leasing an apartment: This could be a hard pull\nor soft pull; check with the landlord or leasing company to\nknow for sure.\nBuying insurance: In most states, auto and homeowners\ninsurance companies run a soft credit check to calculate\nyour credit-based insurance score, which may influence\nyour premium.\nAccount servicing: Some credit card companies may\noccasionally run soft credit checks on existing customers\nto evaluate whether to adjust their account terms, such as a\n\ncredit limit increase or decrease, or to see if you qualify for\na promotional offer.\nHow Long Do Soft Inquiries Stay on\nYour Credit Report?\nLike hard inquiries, soft inquiries remain on your credit reports\nfor up to two years. However, because they're not related to an\napplication for credit or a loan decision, they aren't associated\nwith greater repayment risk and, therefore, have no effect on\nyour credit score.\nHow to Minimize Credit Inquiries\nWhile a hard inquiry will rarely, if ever, be the sole reason you're\ndenied credit, it's still important to be mindful of the number of\nhard inquiries that appear on your credit report. On the flip side,\nsoft inquiries have no impact on your credit, so it's best to\nprioritize soft pulls when possible.\nIn particular, here are some ways to avoid too many hard\ninquiries:\nGet prequalified. Take advantage of prequalification offers\nbefore formally applying for credit. Prequalification typically\ninvolves a soft credit inquiry and provides an idea of your\n\neligibility—and possibly even a rate quote—without affecting\nyour credit score.\nUse the rate-shopping window. When shopping for a\nmortgage, auto loan or private student loan, research and\napply within a specific timeframe (inside a two-week period\nif at all possible). This will ensure that the multiple inquiries\nare treated as a single inquiry, minimizing the impact on\nyour credit score.\nLimit new credit card applications. Because credit cards\nare opened upon approval, applying for multiple credit cards\nin a short period isn't considered rate shopping. As a result,\neach hard inquiry will be counted separately. If you plan to\napply for multiple credit cards, consider spacing out your\napplications by six months or more.\nAvoid unnecessary credit. Before you apply for credit of\nany kind, carefully evaluate your financial situation, needs\nand goals to determine if it's the right decision. Also,\nconsider other ways you can accomplish your objective,\nsuch as saving up instead.\nMonitor your credit. Regularly review your credit reports to\nensure accuracy and identify any unauthorized inquiries or\npotential fraud. You can get free credit monitoring from\nExperian and receive alerts anytime there are changes to\nyour Experian credit report.\n\nCan You Remove Hard Inquiries?\nYou can't remove legitimate hard inquiries from your credit\nreports. However, if you review your credit reports and find a\nhard pull you don't recognize, it could be a red flag.\nMore specifically, it could be an indicator that someone has\nattempted to open a credit account in your name without your\nknowledge or authorization. So, if you find a hard inquiry you're\nunsure about, check for new fraudulent accounts.\nWhether or not there's a new account associated with the\ninquiry, here are some steps you can take to address the issue.\nContact the creditor. Reach out to the creditor in question\nusing the contact information included in your credit report.\nSuspicious inquiries aren't always connected to illegitimate\nactivity. For example, an unfamiliar creditor may turn out to\nbe the lending partner of a retailer where you applied for a\ncredit card or a dealership where you applied for an auto\nloan.\nFile a dispute. You have the right to dispute inaccurate\ncredit report information with the credit bureaus. You can\nfile a dispute directly with each credit reporting agency to\nget the hard inquiry removed.\n\nProtect your credit reports. You have the right to add a\nfraud alert or security freeze to your credit reports, making\nit harder for identity thieves to commit further fraud using\nyour information.\nMonitor Your Credit to Support Your\nFinancial Health\nYour credit report is a living document that's constantly\nchanging. Whether you're working to build your credit score or\nsimply to maintain the progress you've already made, it's\nimportant to check your credit regularly.\nWith Experian's free credit monitoring service, you'll get access\n® Θ\nto your FICO Score  and Experian credit report, making it\neasy to track your progress and get insights about your credit\nhealth.

Whether you are considering buying a simple,\nfixed-rate CD or one with more complex features, here are tips for\nselecting the right CD for your financial needs and goals.\nMake sure you are purchasing a “deposit” product issued by an FDIC-\ninsured bank\nNot all companies with bank-sounding names are actually banks that\nare insured by the FDIC. To verify that an institution is FDIC-insured,\ngo to BankFind (https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/bankfind)\nor contact the FDIC’s toll-free Call Center at 1-877-ASK-FDIC\n(tel:18772753342). Also, get more information by reading The\nImportance of Deposit Insurance and Understanding Your Coverage\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2022-\n08.html).\nIf you purchase a CD from a third-party broker instead of directly from\nan FDIC-insured bank, you will have to rely on the broker to make your\ndeposit and acquire the CD on your behalf. The FDIC does not license\nor register deposit brokers and an unscrupulous broker could mislead\nor defraud its customers. If the broker fails to place your funds into a\nCD at an FDIC-insured bank; your money will not be insured by the\nFDIC. Also, be sure to review the account agreement and other\nsupporting documentation to confirm you are in fact purchasing a CD\nand not a financial product that is not insured by the FDIC. To learn\nmore, visit: Is my money insured by the FDIC? What to consider about\nusing a nonbank\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2023-\n07.html).\n\nIf you purchase a CD issued by an FDIC-insured bank where you\nalready have deposits, make sure that all of your funds are insured\nIf the new CD combined with your existing deposits at the same FDIC-\ninsured bank would put your total bank deposits above the $250,000\nFDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount, you may need to\ntake steps to make sure all of your deposits are fully protected.\nRemember, the $250,000 insurance limit includes the principal and\naccrued interest. If you have more than $250,000 on deposit at a FDIC-\ninsured bank, you can call the FDIC toll-free at 1-877-275-3342\n(tel:18772753342) and speak to a deposit insurance specialist who will\nhelp to make sure you are fully insured. You can also use the FDIC\nElectronic Deposit Insurance Estimator or “EDIE” (https://edie.fdic.gov/)\nto verify your deposit insurance coverage. Find more information at\nAre My Deposit Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\ninsured/).\nKnow what your deposit agreement says about your interest\npayments\nSome banks are offering CDs with variable interest rates based on a\npre-set schedule or tied to the performance of a basket of market\nindices (such as the S&P 500, bonds or foreign currency). Many\nmarket-linked CDs accrue interest only when the CD matures, not\nevery day or every month. More information on deposit disclosures is\nprovided in the January 2021 FDIC Consumer News Article\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2021-\n01.html).\nBe suspicious if the advertised CD rate is far above the competition\nCDs or other products may be offered by a company that is not\nfederally insured, in which case any money invested could be lost if\nthe company goes bankrupt. There is also a common marketing ploy\nto lure customers with a temporary high CD rate with the goal of\neventually selling them something else. A very high interest rate\n\nadvertised on an FDIC-insured bank CD could be a scheme created\nwhen a finance company or an insurance agent adds a small bonus to\nthe CD to lure people in the door and, eventually, tries to sell the\ncustomers uninsured, long-term investments that may not be in their\nbest interest.\nFind out if the CD would automatically renew at the maturity date if\nyou do not withdraw the money\nIf that is the case, check to see if the automatic renewal will be at the\n“old” interest rate or the current rate at the time of the renewal. If\nmarket rates have risen, it may not be to your benefit to renew at the\nold rate. Determine whether you can terminate the CD early. The\nterms of most fixed-rate CDs will allow the depositor to pay a fee to\nredeem the deposit prior to maturity. However, most market-linked\nCDs do not allow for an early redemption. Also be aware that market-\nlinked and other long-term, high-yield CDs typically have “call” features\nthat give the bank the right to close the account early. A callable, fixed-\nrate CD could undermine your ability to lock in an attractive, long-term\ninterest rate. Why? If interest rates fall, the issuing bank may decide to\ncall the CD and give you back your money (plus accrued interest)\nbecause it can issue new CDs at the lower interest rates.\nBy making sure you read your deposit agreement closely, you will\nbetter understand terms of the CD you are purchasing. These CD\nshopping tips will help you choose wisely and avoid scams too.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News Banking with Apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2020-\n11.html)\nFact Sheet: What the Public Needs to Know About FDIC Deposit\nInsurance and Crypto Companies (PDF)\n(https://www.fdic.gov/news/fact-sheets/crypto-fact-sheet-7-28-22.pdf)"

As a small business owner, you may be juggling the\nexpenses of running the day-to-day operations of your business, the\ncosts of expanding your business, and the responsibilities to protect\nyour employees and your customers with your financial choices.\nKnowing you have all of that on your mind, here is some helpful\ninformation and some things to consider about banking for your\nbusiness.\nPayments from your customers\nAs a small business owner, you will need to decide how customers will\npay you. Whether or not to accept debit or credit card payments is an\nimportant decision to make. While these forms of payment are\nconvenient for customers, you may choose not to accept debit or\ncredit cards because of the fees and other costs. You may allow\ncustomers to pay using mobile apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/june2020.html).\nMake sure you carefully read the fine print of any mobile app you’re\nconsidering, so that you are aware of any fees and limitations on\nfunds availability.\nIn general, you will want to comparison shop for a mobile app or debit\nand credit card processing service, since costs and other terms and\nconditions will vary.\n\nDeciding on whether to separate your consumer and business deposit\naccounts\nKeeping your business accounts separate from your personal\naccounts has some benefits. Also, the need for separate accounts\ngenerally increases as a business grows or becomes complex.\nAll deposits owned by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated\nassociation at the same bank are added together and insured up to\n$250,000, separately from the personal accounts\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-\nproducts-insured/) of the owners or members. Note, however, that\ndeposits of a sole proprietorship are aggregated with the owner’s\nother deposits held in his/her name only.\nKeeping your business funds separate from your personal funds,\nsuch as in a business account, may limit personal liability. The\nseparation allows authorized employees to handle day-to-day\nbusiness banking tasks without those employees being involved in\nyour personal finances.\nThe\nInternal Revenue Service (PDF) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-\npdf/p583.pdf)\nalso recommends that you have a business checking account that is\nseparate from your personal accounts. One reason is because doing\nso can make recordkeeping for tax time easier.\nBusiness accounts make it possible for customers to pay with credit\ncards or use checks made out to your business. Remember, if you\ncollect and retain certain customer data, there may be legal\nrequirements to protect it.\nFor more information about what types of accounts are insured by the\nFDIC, please visit: Are My Deposits Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\n\ninsured)\nProtections may vary for consumer versus commercial accounts\nYour liability for unauthorized transactions on your personal debit\ncard accounts is generally capped by federal regulations — $50 or\nmore for debit cards (depending on when you notify the bank). While\nfederal law doesn't protect business debit cards from liability for\nunauthorized transactions, your bank account agreement and state\nlaws could limit your liability. The bottom line: Notify your bank\nimmediately of any problems because state laws, industry standards\nand your deposit agreements may provide\nprotections (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/bank-\naccounts/answers/know-your-rights/)\n.\nWatch out for scams targeting your business\nScammers are out there and will do what they can to exploit your\nbusiness perhaps by stealing information about customers or\nunauthorized withdrawals from a bank account as well as fraudulent\noffers and counterfeit bills. Also, here are a few scams to watch out\nfor, so you can protect your business and your money.\nRansomware is a type of malware created to lock or encrypt files on\nan electronic device like a smart phone or computer. The sender of\nthe ransomware then demands a ransom—generally in the form of a\ndigital asset—in exchange for unlocking or decrypting the information\non your electronic device. The scammer typically threatens to\npublically disclose or sell the compromised information, if the ransom\nis not paid. If you believe your business is a victim of a ransomware\nattack, contact law enforcement immediately. You can also contact a\nlocal field office of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-\nsafety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\nor\n\nU.S. Secret Service (PDF)\n(https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2020-\n12/Preparing%20for%20a%20Cyber%20Incident%20-\n%20A%20Guide%20to%20Ransomware%20v%201.0.pdf)\nto report a ransomware attack and ask for assistance.\nPhishing is a term for scams commonly used when a criminal uses\nemail to ask you to provide personal financial information or financial\ninformation of the small business. The sender pretends to be from a\nbank, a retail store, or government agency and makes the email\nappear legitimate. The approach is often threatening or appears\nurgent in nature. Do not open links or provide financial information\nunless you are sure of the party who is interacting with you. Smishing\nis similar to phishing, but instead of using email, the criminal uses text\nmessaging to reach you.\nVishing, similar to phishing and smishing, is when scammers use\nphone services such as a live phone call, a “robocall,” or a voicemail to\ntry to trick you into providing personal or business information by\nsounding like a legitimate business or government official.\nTo summarize, making sure you choose the right bank for the deposit\nservices or products that you need for your business is really\nimportant. Separating your personal accounts from your business\ndeposit accounts is not only a practical way to run your business, it\nmay also be more efficient. Lastly, stay on the lookout for scams to\nhelp protect your business and customers’ interests.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News: Need a Loan for Your New Small Business?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2023-05/need-loan-\nyour-new-small-business)\n\nFDIC: Money Smart for Small Business\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/money-smart-small-\nbusiness)\nFDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-\ndeposit-insurance)\nSmall Business Administration (SBA):\nOpen a business bank account (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/launch-your-business/open-business-bank-account)\nSBA:\nStrengthen your cybersecurity (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/manage-your-business/strengthen-your-cybersecurity)\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency:\nStopRansomeware.gov (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\nFor more consumer resources, visit FDIC.gov (https://www.fdic.gov/) ,\nor go to the FDIC Knowledge Center\n(https://ask.fdic.gov/fdicinformationandsupportcenter/s/public-\ninformation?language=en_US).

SWIFT codes and IBANs are essential for getting your\nmoney where it needs to go, but they serve completely different\nfunctions in the global banking system.\nWhile both help your money reach its destination, understanding\ntheir distinct roles can save you time and prevent transfer delays.\nThis article breaks down what these codes are, how they differ, and\nexactly which one you'll need for your specific transfer situation.\nWhat is an IBAN?\n\nWhile SWIFT codes direct your money to the right bank, an IBAN\npinpoints the exact account where your funds should land. IBAN\nstands for International Bank Account Number and identifies the\nspecific recipient's bank account.\nHow IBAN works\nIt's widely used in Europe, the Middle East, and several other\nregions\nIBANs help reduce transfer errors and streamline processing\ntimes\nUnlike SWIFT codes that identify banks, IBANs identify\nindividual accounts\nBreaking down an IBAN\nAn IBAN contains up to 34 alphanumeric characters in this structure:\nCC XX BBBB AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA\nCC: Country code (2 letters)\nXX: Check digits (2 numbers for error detection)\nBBBB: Bank identifier (varies by country)\nAAAA... : The recipient's unique account number\nFor example, AT11 2222 3333 4444 5555 6666 7777 would be a\nbank account in Austria.\n\nWhat is a SWIFT code?\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunication. These codes act as your bank's international\naddress, ensuring your money finds its way through the global\nbanking network. When you send money abroad, this unique\nidentifier helps direct your transfer to exactly the right financial\ninstitution.\nHow SWIFT works\nEach bank has its own unique SWIFT code (sometimes called\na BIC, or Bank Identifier Code)\nThe SWIFT system doesn't actually move your money — it\nsends the payment instructions between banks\nThese codes ensure your funds arrive at the correct bank, no\nmatter where in the world you're sending money\nBreaking down a SWIFT code\nA SWIFT code contains 8-11 characters formatted like this: AAAA BB\nCC DDD\n\nAAAA – Bank code (4 letters identifying the bank)\nBB – Country code (2 letters identifying the country)\nCC – Location code (2 characters specifying the bank's city\nor region)\nDDD – Optional branch code (3 characters identifying the\nspecific branch)\nFor example, BOFAUS3N ¹ identifies Bank of America in New York,\nUSA.\nIBAN vs. SWIFT: Key differences\nKnowing when to use SWIFT codes versus IBANs can save you time\nand prevent transfer delays. While they both play crucial roles in\ninternational banking, they serve completely different functions in\ngetting your money where it needs to go.\nHere's how these two banking identifiers compare:\nFeature IBAN SWIFT\nSociety for Worldwide\nWhat It International Bank Account\nInterbank Financial\nStands For Number\nTelecommunication\nMain Identifies individual bank\nIdentifies banks globally\nPurpose accounts\nUsed for identifying specific Used for routing payments\nRole\naccounts internationally\nFormat Up to 34 characters 8-11 characters\n\nVaries by country, aligned with\nRegulatory\nISO (International Organization SWIFT organization\nBody\nfor Standardization) standards\nWhere Itʼs Mainly Europe, Middle East, and\nWorldwide\nUsed select regions\nWhich code should you use for your international\ntransfer?\nSo, how will you know whether you need a SWIFT code, an IBAN, or\nboth? The answer depends on where your money is headed. Getting\nit right the first time helps your transfer arrive faster and avoids\npotential processing delays.\nWhen to use each code\nSending to Europe, the Middle East, or the Caribbean? You'll\nlikely need an IBAN, and possibly a SWIFT code too\nSending to the USA, Canada, Australia, or Asia? A SWIFT\ncode is typically required\nSome countries require both SWIFT codes direct your money\nto the right bank, while the IBAN ensures it lands in the\ncorrect account\nReal-world transfer scenarios\nLet's break this down with some everyday examples:\n\nSending money to your sister studying in Germany? You'll\nneed her IBAN, and possibly her bank's SWIFT code too.\nEuropean banks rely heavily on IBANs for accurate account\nidentification.\nHelping your husband transfer funds to a business partner\nin Japan? You'll only need the recipient's SWIFT code, as\nJapan's banking system doesn't use IBANs.\nSupporting family in the UK? You'll need both codes - the\nSWIFT code routes your money to the right bank, while the\nIBAN ensures it reaches your family member's specific\naccount.\nNot sure what you need? Ask your recipient to check their\nbank statement or contact their bank directly. They can\nprovide exactly what's required for their country's banking\nsystem.\nEnsuring transfer success\nBefore hitting \"send\" on your international transfer, take a moment to\nverify all codes are correct. Even a single mistaken character can\nsend your money to the wrong destination or cause processing\ndelays.\nYou can find your own bank codes on your account statement or by\nlogging into your online banking portal. If you're uncertain about any\ndetails, check out Xeʼs IBAN calculator to lookup and verify your\nIBAN information."

      "reference_material_content": "Investor.gov\nU.S. SECURITIES AND\nEXCHANGE COMMISSION\nExchange-\nTraded Funds\n(ETFs)\nPlease note - this page discusses only ETFs that are\nregistered as open-end investment companies or\nunit investment trusts under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940. It does not address other\ntypes of exchange-traded products\n(/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/exchange-traded-products-etps)\n, such as exchange-traded commodity trusts or\nexchange-traded notes.\nWhat are ETFs?\nAn ETF is an exchange-traded investment product\nthat must register with the SEC as an open-end\n\ninvestment company or a unit investment trust.\nETFs pool money from many investors and invest\nthe money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-\nmarket instruments, other securities or assets, or\nsome combination of these investments. The\ncombined holdings the ETF owns are known as its\nportfolio, which is usually managed by an SEC-\nregistered investment adviser. Each ETF share\nrepresents an investor’s part ownership of the ETF’s\nportfolio and the income the portfolio generates.\nWhy do people buy ETFs?\nETFs are a popular choice among investors because\nthey generally offer the following features:\nProfessional Management. Most ETFs are\ntypically managed by investment advisers who\nare registered with the SEC.\nDiversification. Many ETFs invest in a range\nof companies and industries rather than\ninvesting in one specific stock or bond. This\nhelps to lower your risk if one company fails.\nHowever, some ETFs are less diverse than\nothers. They may have fewer investments or\nmay even track the performance of a single\nstock (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/single-stock-etfs) .\n\nLow Minimum Investment. ETF shares can\nbe purchased on the market often for\nrelatively low dollar amounts.\nLiquidity. ETF investors can trade their shares\non the market at the market price whenever\nthe market is open—minus any fees.\nTax Advantage. Because many ETFs buy and\nsell portfolio securities in in-kind exchange\n(rather than for cash), they typically have\nfewer capital gains distributions – and thus\nlower taxes – than mutual funds.\nHow do I earn money from ETFs?\nInvestors can make money from their ETF\ninvestments in three ways:\nDividend Payments. A fund may earn income\nfrom its portfolio – for example, dividends on\nstock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays\nthe shareholders nearly all the income, less\nexpenses, as a dividend payment.\nCapital Gains Distributions. The price of the\nsecurities a fund owns may increase. When a\nfund sells a security that has increased in\nprice, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of\nthe year, the fund distributes these capital\ngains, minus any capital losses, to investors.\n\nIncreased Market Price. If the market value\nof an ETF’s portfolio increases, after deduction\nof expenses and liabilities, then the net asset\nvalue (NAV)\n(https://www.investor.gov/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/net-asset-\nvalue) of the ETF increases, and the market\nprice of its shares may also increase.\nIf an ETF investor wants to reinvest a dividend\npayment or capital gains distribution, the process\ncan be more complicated than it is with mutual\nfunds. In addition, the investor may have to pay\nadditional brokerage commissions. Investors\nshould check with their ETF or investment\nprofessional.\nWhat are the risks of investing in ETFs?\nLike mutual funds, ETFs are not guaranteed or\ninsured by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. They therefore all carry some level of risk.\nYou may lose some or all of the money you invest\nbecause the securities held by a fund can go down\nin value. Dividends or interest payments may also\nchange as market conditions change.\nA fund’s past performance is not as important as\nyou might think because past performance does\n\nnot predict future returns. But past performance\ncan tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been\nover a period of time. The more volatile the fund,\nthe higher the investment risk.\nDifferent funds have different risks and rewards\ndepending on their investment objectives.\nGenerally, the higher the potential return, the\nhigher the risk of loss.\nWhat do I pay for my ETF?\nAs with any business, running an ETF involves costs.\nFunds pass along these costs to investors by\ndeducting fees and expenses from NAV. That\nmeans you pay the fees and expenses indirectly.\nFees and expenses vary from fund to fund. It is\nimportant to understand what fees and expenses\nan ETF charges and how those fees and expenses\nimpact your investment. Even small differences in\nfees and expenses can mean large differences in\nreturns over time. In addition, a fund with high\ncosts must perform better than a low-cost fund to\ngenerate the same returns for you.\nRead Mutual Fund and ETF Fees and Expenses -\nInvestor Bulletin (/introduction-investing/general-\nresources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\n\nbulletins-20) to learn about some of the most\ncommon ETF fees and expenses. Also check out the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\nFund Analyzer (/financial-tools-\ncalculators/financial-tools/mutual-fund-analyzer) to\ncompute how the costs of different funds add up\nover time and eat into your returns.\nWhat are some common ETF investing strategies?\nIndex Funds. Index funds follow a passive\ninvestment strategy that is designed to\nachieve approximately the same return as a\nparticular index before fees. An index fund\nwill attempt to achieve its investment\nobjective primarily by investing in the\nsecurities of companies that are included in a\nselected index. Passive management usually\ntranslates into less trading of the fund’s\nportfolio (fewer transaction costs), more\nfavorable income tax consequences (lower\nrealized capital gains), and lower fees than\nactively managed funds.\nActively Managed Funds. Actively managed\nfunds are not based on an index. Instead,\nthey seek to achieve a stated investment\nobjective by investing in a portfolio of stocks,\nbonds, and other assets. An adviser of an\nactively managed fund may actively buy or sell\n\ninvestments in the portfolio on a daily basis\nwithout regard to conformity with an index.\nBut the trades must be consistent with the\noverall investment objective and strategies of\nthe fund. An actively managed fund has the\npotential to outperform the market or its\nchosen benchmark, but its performance is\nheavily dependent on the skill of the manager.\nWhat types of ETFs are there?\nETFs fall into several main categories. Each type has\ndifferent features, risks, and rewards.\nStock funds (/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/stock-\nfund) invest primarily in stocks or equities. A\nstock is an instrument that represents an\nownership interest (called equity) in a\ncompany and a proportional share in the\ncompany’s assets and profits. The types of\nstocks owned by a stock fund depend upon\nthe fund’s investment objectives, policies, and\nstrategies. A stock fund’s value can rise and\nfall quickly (and dramatically) over the short\nterm. The fund’s performance depends, in\npart, on whether the underlying companies do\nwell or not.\n\nBond funds (/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/bond-\nfunds-and-income-funds) or income funds\ninvest primarily in bonds or other types of\ndebt securities. Depending on its investment\nobjectives and policies, a bond fund may\nconcentrate its investments in a particular\ntype of bond or debt security or a mixture of\ntypes. The securities that bond funds hold will\nvary in terms of risk, return, duration,\nvolatility and other features.\nTarget date funds (/news-alerts/investor-\nbulletins/target-date-retirement-funds)\ntypically hold a mix of stock funds, bond funds\nand other funds, and are created for\nindividuals with a particular date for\nretirement or other goal in mind. Target date\nfunds are designed to make investing for\nretirement or other goals more convenient by\nchanging their investment mix as the target\ndate gets closer. However, be aware that if a\ntarget date fund invests in other funds, it may\nhave a double layer of fees.\nMoney market fund ETFs (/introduction-\ninvesting/general-resources/news-\nalerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\nbulletins/updated-12) invest in liquid, short-\nterm debt securities, cash and cash\nequivalents."

The asset allocation decision is a personal\n\none. The allocation that works best for you changes\nat different times in your life, depending on how\nlong you have to invest and your ability to tolerate\nrisk.\nFactors to consider include your:\nTime Horizon. Your time horizon is the number of\nmonths, years, or decades you need to invest to\nachieve your financial goal. Investors with a longer\ntime horizon may feel comfortable taking on riskier\nor more volatile investments. Those with a shorter\ntime horizon may prefer to take on less risk.\nRisk Tolerance (/investing-basics/guiding-\nprinciples/assessing-your-risk-tolerance) . Risk\ntolerance is your ability and willingness to lose\nsome or all of your original investment in exchange\nfor potentially greater returns.\nWhat is diversification?\nWhat is rebalancing?\n()\n() What is diversification?\nThe practice of spreading money among different\ninvestments to reduce risk is known as\n\ndiversification. Diversification is a strategy that can\nbe neatly summed up as “Don’t put all your eggs in\none basket.”\nOne way to diversify is to allocate your investments\namong different kinds of assets. Historically, stocks,\nbonds, and cash have not moved up and down at\nthe same time. Factors that may cause one asset\nclass to perform poorly may improve returns for\nanother asset class. People invest in various asset\nclasses in the hope that if one is losing money, the\nothers make up for those losses.\nYou’ll also be better diversified if you spread your\ninvestments within each asset class. That means\nholding a number of different stocks or bonds, and\ninvesting in different industry sectors, such as\nconsumer goods, health care, and technology. That\nway, if one sector is doing poorly, you may offset it\nwith other holdings in sectors that are doing well.\nSome investors find it easier to diversify by owning\nmutual funds. A mutual fund is a company that\npools money from many investors and invests the\nmoney in stocks, bonds, and other financial\nproducts. Mutual funds make it easy for investors\nto own a small portion of many investments. A total\nstock market index fund, for example, owns stock\n\nin thousands of companies, providing a lot of\ndiversification for one investment.\nA mutual fund won’t necessarily provide\ndiversification, especially if it focuses on only one\nindustry sector. If you invest in narrowly focused\nmutual funds, you may need to invest in several to\nbe diversified. As you add more investments to\nyour portfolio, you’ll likely pay additional fees and\nexpenses, which will lower your investment\nreturns. So you’ll need to consider these costs when\ndeciding the best way to diversify your portfolio.\n() What is rebalancing?\nRebalancing is what investors do to bring their\nportfolio back to its original asset allocation mix.\nRebalancing is needed because over time, some\ninvestments will grow faster than others. This may\npush your holdings out of alignment with your\ninvestment goals. By rebalancing, you will ensure\nthat your portfolio does not overweight a particular\nasset category, and you’ll return your portfolio to a\ncomfortable level of risk.\nFor example, you might start with 60% of your\nportfolio invested in stocks, but see that rise to 80%\ndue to market gains. To reestablish your original\n\nasset allocation mix, you’ll either need to sell some\nof your stocks or invest in other asset categories.\nThere are three ways you can rebalance your\nportfolio:\n1. You can sell investments where your holdings\nare over weighted and use the proceeds to\nbuy investments for underweighted asset\ncategories.\n2. You can buy new investments for\nunderweighted asset categories.\n3. If you are continuing to add to your\ninvestments, you can alter your contributions\nso that more goes to underweighted asset\ncategories until your portfolio is back into\nbalance.\nBefore you rebalance your portfolio, you should\nconsider whether the method of rebalancing you\ndecide to use would entail transaction fees or tax\nconsequences. Your financial professional or tax\nadviser can help you identify ways that you can\nminimize these potential costs.\nSome financial experts advise rebalancing at\nregular intervals, such as every six or 12 months.\nOthers recommend rebalancing when your\nholdings of an asset class increase or decrease\n\nmore than a certain pre-set percentage. In either\ncase, rebalancing tends to work best when done on\na relatively infrequent basis.\nShifting money away from an asset class when it is\ndoing well in favor of an asset category that is\ndoing poorly may not be easy. But it can be a wise\nmove. By cutting back on current “winners” and\nadding more current “losers,” rebalancing forces\nyou to buy low and sell high."

Making your money work for you\nmeans you use your money to make more money. One\n\nway to do that is by earning interest on the money you\nalready have.\nWhat exactly is interest?\nWhen you deposit money in a savings account at a\nbank, the money you deposit is called principal. The\nmoney you earn on your principal is called interest. You\nget to keep the interest. This is money the bank pays\nyou to keep your money with them. Interest is earned\nafter a period of time, like each month. Compound\ninterest is what you earn on your principal after the\nfirst month that helps your money grow.\nWhat is compound interest?\nYou deposited your principal in the bank and earned\ninterest; they are added together to become your new\nprincipal. The next time you earn interest, you earn\ninterest on your new principal. Every time you earn\ninterest, it is added to your principal. Earning money on\nyour principal and interest over and over again is\ncompound interest. The longer your money is in a\nsavings account, the more you earn. In addition,\ndifferent banks offer different interest rates; the higher\nthe interest rate, the faster your money will grow.\n\nNoah saved $100 from his allowance and birthday\nmoney. At the beginning of July, he deposited that\nmoney into a savings account at a local FDIC-insured\nbank. The bank pays 3 percent (3 percent = .03) interest\ncompounded monthly. With only his $100 deposit and\ncompounding interest, how much will Noah have in his\naccount by the end of the year?\nLet’s figure it out. Multiply Noah’s $100 principal by 3\npercent interest. So, $100 x .03 equals $3 in interest.\nAdd the $100 and $3 to get Noah’s new principal of\n$103. At the end of the July, Noah will have $103 in his\nsavings account. For August, Noah’s principal is $103.\nMultiply by 3 percent ($103 x .03) to figure out his\ncompounding interest, which is $3.09. Add that to $103\nand his new balance for August with interest is $106.09.\nYou can see in the table below that Noah’s $100\ndeposit from July with 3 percent compounding interest\nhas now earned $19.41. All he did was leave his money\nin his account.\n\nMonth Principal Interest Balance\nJuly $100.00 $3.00 $103.00\nAugust $103.00 $3.09 $106.09\nSeptember $106.09 $3.18 $109.27\nOctober $109.27 $3.28 $112.55\nNovember $112.55 $3.38 $115.93\nDecember $115.93 $3.48 $119.41\nThe power of compound interest and time is really\nimportant as you figure out budgeting, saving,\nspending, and sharing.

      "reference_material_content": "Consumer Resource Center\nDeposit Accounts\nSavings Are Great for Short-Term Goals Too\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/s\neptember2018.html)\nOpening a deposit account at an FDIC-insured\nfinancial institution can be one of the most\nimportant steps you take toward achieving your\nfinancial goals.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of opening an account\nat an insured bank is deposit insurance. The\nstandard FDIC insurance amount is $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank, for each account\nownership category. However, depositors benefit\nfrom other consumer protections as well.\nBelow is some information about the most common\ndeposit accounts, the consumer protections\nprovided for those accounts, and other information.\nDeposit Account Basics\nOther Services Deposit Accounts May Offer\nConsumer Protections on Deposit Accounts\nBilling Error and Resolution Basics\nAdditional Resources\nDeposit Account Basics\nDeposit products include savings accounts, checking\naccounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money\nmarket accounts.\n\nchecking account\nA is a transactional account. It is\ndesigned for individuals to deposit money into it and\ntake money out of it frequently. People usually use\nchecking accounts to keep their money available for\npaying bills and withdrawing money for regular use.\nMoney in a checking account may earn interest.\nsavings account\nA is used to set aside money for the\nfuture. People usually use savings accounts to\ndeposit money they do not expect to need or use on\na regular basis.\nCD\nA is another type of account consumers can use\nto set aside money for the future. Unlike a savings\naccount, you cannot withdraw funds from a CD\nwhenever you like. Typically, you must keep money\nin a CD for a certain period of time or you will likely\nhave to pay a penalty or lose some or all of the\ninterest you earned. The required period of time\ncould be three months to five years or more. In\naddition, there may be a required minimum deposit.\nCDs typically offer a higher rate of interest than\nregular savings accounts.\n\nmoney market\nSome financial institutions offer\naccounts\n(also known as money market deposit\naccounts or money market savings accounts) to\nconsumers. These accounts usually pay a higher rate\nof interest and require a higher minimum balance\nthan some other account options. Unlike CDs, there\nis no requirement that you keep your money in the\naccount for a designated period of time.\nBack to top\nOther Services Deposit Accounts\nMay Offer\nTypically, banks offer a number of services with their\ndeposit accounts. Depending on the institution,\nthese may include:\nCheck cashing – This is converting a check to cash.\nYou will generally not have to pay a fee to cash a\ncheck at a financial institution where you have an\naccount.\n\nDirect deposit - With both checking and savings\naccounts, direct deposit allows your money to be\nsafely and securely electronically deposited into your\naccount.\nMoney orders – Money orders can be used to send\nmoney to individuals or businesses. With a money\norder, you provide the amount of money you want\nto pay plus a fee to a bank, store, or the U.S. Postal\nService. They then give you a piece of paper (the\nmoney order) that may look like a check that you can\nuse to send the money. You do not need an account\nat a financial institution to purchase a money order.\nSome businesses require consumers to pay with a\nmoney orders because it is consider a safer form of\npayment than a personal check because the funds\nhave already been provided in order to purchase the\nmoney order. There’s no chance of a money order\n“bouncing”. Using a money order also keeps a\nconsumer from having to worry about overdraft or\nnon-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. In addition, money\norders are usually easy to replace if they’re lost or\nstolen.\n\nCashier’s checks – These are checks that are\nguaranteed by a financial institution. When you\npurchase a cashier’s check, the bank takes the\nmoney from your checking or savings account and\nputs it in its own account. The bank then writes out a\ncheck to the person or business you need to pay.\nLike a money order, a cashier’s check is considered a\nsafer form of payment than a personal check -- in\nthis case, because the check is guaranteed by the\nfinancial institution. Again, the check is guaranteed\nnot to bounce. And, again, a cashier’s check can be\nreplaced if it is lost or stolen.\nPrepaid cards – With prepaid cards, you are\nspending funds that have been deposited onto\nthem. They usually aren’t linked to your checking or\nsavings account. Instead, funds are loaded onto a\ncard you can use to make purchases and get cash.\nEach time the card is used, the balance on the card\nis reduced by the amount spent. Sometimes there\nare fees associated with using a prepaid card.\nDebit cards – With debit cards, you are spending\nfunds that are in your checking or savings account.\nEach time you use the card, the balance in your\n\naccount is reduced by the amount spent, as well as\nany associated fees. Debit cards can be used at\nautomated teller machines (ATMs). They can also be\nused for purchases, both online and at “point of\npurchase” (e.g., stores, restaurants, or gas stations).\nAutomated teller machines (ATMs) – These machines\ncan process a variety of banking transactions,\nincluding accepting deposits and loan payments,\nproviding cash for withdrawals, and transferring\nmoney between accounts.\nATM cards – ATM cards allow you to use an ATM for\nvarious account transactions. Certain ATM cards can\nalso be used to make purchases.\nOnline or mobile banking, including bill-paying\nservices – This refers to managing your accounts\nusing the internet on a computer or mobile device.\nDepending on the bank, there may be a number of\nservices accessible online or through an app:\nView up-to-date information on your account\nbalance to help reconcile your accounts on a more\nfrequent basis.\n\nSet up automatic payments from your account to\npay your bills.\nReceive alerts when you have a new bill to pay from\nsome companies, such as utilities.\nDeposit checks remotely, in some cases, by taking a\npicture of the front and back of the check you want\nto deposit.\n“Person-to-person” payments (P2P) – This refers to\nmobile apps or other web-based services that allow\nperson-to-person money transfers. Typically, users\nlink the mobile payment system to their bank\naccounts or credit card accounts and initiate\ntransfers of funds to others who are also users of\nthe same app or web-based service.\nThere are several mobile person-to-person payment\napps and they differ in how they work. One may let\nyou transfer money after logging into a website.\nAnother may let you transfer money by physically\ntouching your phone to another person’s phone.\nRemittance transfers – These transfers are used to\nmove money to a person or business in another\ncountry. They may also be referred to as\n\n“international wires,” “international money\ntransfers,” or “remittances.”\nBack to top"

      "reference_material_content": "Investor.gov\nU.S. SECURITIES AND\nEXCHANGE COMMISSION\nAn Introduction to 529 Plans -\nInvestor Bulletin\nJan. 28, 2026\nThe SEC’s Office of Investor Education and\nAssistance is issuing this Investor Bulletin to\nprovide investors with background information on\n529 plans. Please also see our companion Bulletin\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\nbulletin-10-questions-consider-before) for a few\nquestions to consider before opening a 529 plan\naccount.\nWhat is a 529 plan?\nA 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan\ndesigned to encourage saving for future education\ncosts. 529 plans, legally known as “qualified tuition\nplans,” are sponsored by states, state agencies, or\neducational institutions and are authorized by\nSection 529 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThere are two types of 529 plans: education savings\nplans and prepaid tuition plans. Most education\nsavings plans are available to everyone, but a few\nhave residency requirements for the saver and/or\nbeneficiary. Prepaid tuition plans typically have\nresidency requirements. One exception is a prepaid\ntuition plan sponsored by a group of private\ncolleges and universities.\nThe person who opens the 529 plan account is\ncalled the account holder or the saver. The person\nthe account is opened for is called\nthe beneficiary or the student. The account holder\nand the beneficiary can be the same person.\nWhat are the differences between education\nsavings plans and prepaid tuition plans?\nEducation Savings Plans. Education savings plans\nlet a saver open an investment account to save for\nthe beneficiary’s future qualified higher education\nexpenses (https://www.investor.gov/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/qualified-\nhigher-education-expenses) . Qualified higher\neducation expenses include tuition and certain\nexpenses for post-secondary education and\nrecognized post-secondary credential programs.\nWithdrawals from education savings plan accounts\ncan generally be used at any college or university,\n\nincluding sometimes at non-U.S. colleges and\nuniversities, or at a recognized post-secondary\ncredential program. Education savings plans can\nalso be used to pay for other education-related\nexpenses. These include up to $20,000 per year per\nbeneficiary for tuition and certain expenses at any\npublic, private, or religious elementary or\nsecondary school; certain expenses required for\nparticipation in registered apprenticeship\nprograms; and qualified education loan\nrepayments up to $10,000 total per beneficiary.\nA saver may typically choose among a range of\ninvestment options, which often include\nvarious mutual fund\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/mutual-\nfunds) and exchange-traded fund\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/exchange-\ntraded-fund-etf) (ETF) investments and a principal-\nprotected bank product. Education savings plans\nalso may include static fund portfolios and age-\nbased portfolios (sometimes called target-date\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/target-date-\nfund) portfolios). These portfolios include a\ncombination of different types of ETFs and/or\nmutual funds and are designed to help diversify the\n\nrisk in the account. Typically age-based portfolios\nautomatically shift funds into more conservative\ninvestments as the beneficiary gets closer to\ncollege age, but static fund portfolios will keep the\nsame mix of investments. If you are using a 529\naccount to pay for elementary or secondary school\ntuition, you may have a shorter time horizon for\nyour money to grow. You may not feel comfortable\ntaking on riskier or more volatile investments if you\nplan on withdrawing the money soon. Therefore,\nyou may consider different investment options\ndepending on when you plan to use the money that\nis invested.\nAll education savings plans are sponsored by state\ngovernments, but only a few have residency\nrequirements for the saver and/or beneficiary.\nState governments do not guarantee investments\nin education savings plans. Education savings plan\ninvestments in mutual funds and ETFs are not\nfederally guaranteed, but investments in some\nprincipal-protected bank products may be insured\nby the FDIC. As with most investments, you can lose\nmoney in an education savings plan.\nPrepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans let a\nsaver or account holder purchase units or credits\nfor the beneficiary to use in the future at\nparticipating colleges and universities. The saver is\n\nessentially pre-paying future tuition and\nmandatory fees at the current prices of tuition and\nmandatory fees. The participating colleges and\nuniversities are typically public, in-state institutions\nin the state that sponsors the plan. Prepaid tuition\nplans are not as flexible as education savings plans\nbecause the credits can only be used for future\ntuition and mandatory fees at certain schools. If\nthe beneficiary does not attend a participating\ncollege or university, they can typically still receive\nmoney from the plan to help pay for college tuition\nand mandatory fees, but the amount is determined\nby the particular plan.\nMost prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by state\ngovernments and have residency requirements for\nthe saver and/or beneficiary. Prepaid plans are not\nguaranteed by the federal government. Some state\ngovernments guarantee the money paid into the\nprepaid tuition plans that they sponsor, but some\ndo not. If your prepaid tuition payments aren’t\nguaranteed, you may lose some or all of your\nmoney in the plan if the plan’s sponsor has a\nfinancial shortfall. In addition, if a beneficiary\ndoesn’t attend a participating college or university,\nthe prepaid tuition plan may pay less than if the\nbeneficiary attended a participating college or\nuniversity. It may only pay a small return on the\n\noriginal investment, depending on how the plan\ncalculates your return.\nWhat fees and expenses will I pay if I invest in a\n529 plan?\nIt is important to understand the fees and\nexpenses associated with 529 plans because they\nlower your returns. Fees and expenses will vary\nbased on the type of 529 plan (education savings\nplan or prepaid tuition plan), whether it is a broker-\nor direct-sold plan, the plan itself and the\nunderlying investments. You should carefully\nreview the plan’s offering circular to understand\nwhat fees are charged for the plan and each\ninvestment option.\nEducation Savings Plans. Education savings plans\nmay charge an enrollment/application fee, annual\naccount maintenance fees, ongoing program\nmanagement fees, and ongoing asset management\nfees. The asset management fees will depend on\nthe investment option you select. Investors that\npurchase an education savings plan from a broker\nare typically subject to additional fees, such as\nsales loads or charges at the time of investment or\nredemption and ongoing distribution fees.\n\nPrepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans may\ncharge an enrollment/application fee and ongoing\nadministrative fees.\n\nWhat restrictions apply to an investment in a\n529 plan?\nThere will likely be restrictions on any 529 plan you\nmay be considering. Before you invest in a 529 plan,\nyou should read the plan’s offering circular to make\n\nsure that you understand and are comfortable with\nany plan restrictions.\nInvestments. Education savings plans have certain\npre-set investment options. It is not permitted to\nswitch freely among the options. Under current tax\nlaw, an account holder is only permitted to change\nhis or her investment option twice per year or\nwhen there is a change in the beneficiary.\nWithdrawals. With limited exceptions, you can only\nwithdraw money that you invest in an education\nsavings plan without incurring taxes and penalties\nfor qualified higher education expenses or the\nother expenses discussed above. One exception is\nthat you can rollover funds in a 529 account into a\nRoth IRA account for the same beneficiary with\nsome restrictions, which are explained above.\nBeneficiaries of prepaid tuition plans may only use\ntheir purchased credits or units at participating\ncolleges or universities. If a beneficiary doesn’t\nattend a participating college or university, the\nprepaid tuition plan may pay less than if the\nbeneficiary attended a participating college or\nuniversity. It may only pay a small return on the\noriginal investment, depending on how the plan\ncalculates your return."

      "reference_material_content": "Investor.gov\nU.S. SECURITIES AND\nEXCHANGE COMMISSION\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs) –\nInvestor Bulletin\nDec. 9, 2025\nThe SEC’s Office of Investor Education and\nAssistance is issuing this Investor Bulletin to inform\ninvestors about health savings accounts (HSAs),\nwhich offer tax benefits when used to pay for\nqualified medical expenses. We encourage you to\nalso consult Internal Revenue Service\n(https://www.irs.gov/) (IRS) guidance on HSAs.\nWhat is a health savings account\n(HSA)?\nA health savings account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged\nsavings account you can use to pay for qualified\nmedical expenses. Qualified medical expenses can\ninclude, for example, doctor and hospital bills,\nprescription medicine, and dental and vision costs.\nHSAs come with federal and sometimes state tax\nbenefits, which means using an HSA instead of a\n\ntraditional checking or savings account to pay for\nqualified medical expenses\n(https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-\npublication-502) can help you save money.\nYou can put money in an HSA like you would a\ntypical deposit account. Some HSAs also allow you\nto invest your money, including in securities like\nmutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You\ncan use HSA money to pay for both current and\nfuture medical expenses.\nHSAs can be used for spending, saving, and\ninvesting. An HSA can be used as a spending\naccount for current medical expenses, a savings\naccount for unexpected medical costs, and an\ninvestment account to grow your assets for medical\nexpenses in the future, like during retirement.\nHow does an HSA work?\nRequires a high-deductible health insurance\nplan (HDHP). By law, you can only contribute\nmoney to an HSA if you participate in an HDHP.\nHSAs are often offered as part of employer-\nsponsored HDHPs. You can use HSA money to pay\nfor qualified medical expenses not covered by your\nHDHP.\n\nContributions. You can deposit money into your\nHSA like you would a regular savings account. If\nyour HSA is set up through your employer, you\nmight have the option to contribute through\npayroll deductions. Your employer can also choose\nto contribute. The IRS sets limits on total annual\ncontributions.\nNo “use it or lose it.” Any unused balance in your\nHSA is generally carried over year after year. There\nis no deadline to use your HSA balance, including if\nyou stop participating in an HDHP.\nReimbursement. If you pay for a qualified medical\nexpense out of pocket, you can reimburse yourself\nfor that expense using your HSA money— as long\nas the expense was incurred after you established\nthe HSA. State law determines when an HSA is\nestablished.\nWhat about investing HSA savings?\nOpportunity to invest. Some, but not all, HSAs\nallow you to invest some or all of your HSA balance.\nIn some cases, a minimum account balance may\napply before you are eligible to make investments.\nIf you plan to use your HSA for future healthcare\ncosts, you might consider investing some or all of\n\nyour HSA savings. The longer your money is\ninvested, the more opportunity it has to grow.\nInvestment choices. The investment options\noffered by HSAs may vary widely. Some HSAs offer\nseveral investment products, while others may\noffer only a few options. Examples of potential\ninvestment options include mutual funds\n(/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-\nexchange-traded-funds-etfs/mutual-funds) and\nETFs (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-\nexchange-traded-2) .\nFees. If you invest your money, you may pay\nadditional fees. These additional fees typically\ninclude underlying fund fees and transaction fees\nin addition to any HSA account maintenance fees.\nOther fees may apply as well. Over time, fees can\nimpact the performance of your investment\nportfolio. Be sure you understand the total cost of\nyour HSA and any investments you choose to make.\nWhat are the federal tax benefits of\nusing an HSA?\nHSAs provide a triple tax advantage.\n\nContributions. When you contribute money to\nyour HSA through payroll deductions, you are\ncontributing pre-tax dollars. For other\ncontributions, you can claim a tax deduction\nthat reduces your federal taxable income.\nEarnings. Any earnings in your HSA (such as\nfrom interest or investment gains) are not\nsubject to federal tax while they remain in your\nHSA.\nWithdrawals. HSA withdrawals for qualified\nmedical expenses are not subject to federal\ntax.\nSome, but not all, states offer tax benefits for HSAs.\nIn addition, state and federal laws that affect HSAs\ncould change. You should make sure you\nunderstand the tax implications of using an HSA\nand consider whether to consult a tax adviser.\nHow can I open an HSA?\nYou can open an HSA with the financial institution\nof your choice, as long as you are eligible to open\nand contribute to an HSA. Consult IRS guidelines to\ndetermine if you are eligible\n(https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4885.pdf) .\n\nBanks, credit unions, and other financial\ninstitutions offer HSAs.\nIf your employer offers an HDHP, they might also\noffer you the option of opening an HSA. Some\nemployers may only offer employer contributions\nand direct payroll deductions into an HSA with a\ncertain provider. However, other HSA options\nmay be available to you. Don’t be afraid to shop\naround for the HSA that suits you best.\nBe sure you understand any restrictions and fees\nthat apply before opening an HSA. This will help\nyou make the most of your HSA.\nWhat are some other features of\nHSAs?\nEase of access. Some HSAs allow you to pay for\nqualifying expenses directly using a linked debit\ncard or online bill payment system. Others may\nrequire you to pay for eligible expenses out of your\nown pocket and request reimbursement from your\nHSA.\nAccount maintenance fees. Some HSAs charge a\nmonthly account maintenance fee. Other HSAs may\nhave no account maintenance fee or may waive the\nfee if your account has a sufficiently high balance.\n\nInterest. Some HSAs pay interest on money you\ndon’t spend immediately or invest.\nWhat happens if I use my HSA for\nnon-medical expenses?\nThe answer depends on your age.\nBefore age 65. HSA dollars are subject to federal\nincome taxes and a federal tax penalty if used on\nany non-medical expenses before age 65.\nAge 65 and beyond. After you turn 65, you can use\nthe money in your HSA for anything without paying\nthe penalty. However, you will still have to pay\nfederal income taxes on the money if you don’t use\nit for qualified medical expenses.\nCan I move my existing HSA?\nIf you already have an HSA, such as through your\nemployer, you are allowed to move your HSA assets\n(cash and/or investments) to an HSA with a\ndifferent provider. For example, you might consider\nmoving your HSA assets to a provider with\ninvestment options that better fit your financial\ngoals.\nIf you have multiple HSAs, such as from different\nemployers over the years, you might consider\n\nconsolidating them into one HSA for ease of\nmanagement.\nIf you have an HSA through your employer and you\nchange jobs or retire, you can take your HSA with\nyou (keeping it with the existing HSA provider or\nmoving it to a different one).\nMoving your HSA assets can be done by transfer or\nrollover. Transfers and rollovers are very specific\nprocesses. Before you transfer or roll over money\nfrom one HSA to another, make sure you\nunderstand the rules around doing so and any tax\nconsequences. Consider whether to consult your\nHSA provider, IRS guidance,\nyour state’s tax law and/or a tax professional."
