(attribution: Copyright Rice\nUniversity, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nIn the following discussion, we expand on some of these reasons for failure and offer advice on how to avoid\nthem. Considering the following failures will give you an idea of what may go wrong in a business but will also\nhelp you spot and correct them before you launch.\nMarketing Failure\nSome of the most common failures result from marketing missteps.\n• Lack of differentiation of product or service. Creating or running a company with a me-too mentality and\nwithout a clear unique selling proposition or difference from other established businesses can be\ndetrimental. Answering questions such as “Why should customers leave other companies to buy my\nproduct?” “What is a benefit I provide that no one else does?” and “If I open a yogurt parlor in a\ncommercial area, what will help my business differentiate itself from all the other yogurt, ice cream,\ndessert, and fast food places?” can help create ways to be special rather than a me-too business. This also\nneeds to be defined in your mission, within your products and their benefits, and a clearly defined\ncompetitive advantagethat can be translated into asuperior value proposition. The chapters on\nEntrepreneurial Marketing and SalesandIdentifying Entrepreneurial Opportunitydiscuss competitive\nadvantages and value propositions in more detail.\n• Missing the right customer. Not reaching thetarget marketcan lead to failure. Perhaps for your travel tour\n\n406 Chapter 10 Launch for Growth to Success\nbusiness, you targeted single people ages 18–34 who like to experience travel in a different way, but\nmaybe your true target—the people who want to book your tours—are couples with children and those\n50 and over. You would have sent out marketing communications to the wrong age group. Or, the right\nmessage is not being conveyed and your positioning is off, preventing you from connecting with your\ntrue consumer. Conductingmarket researchas discussed inEntrepreneurial Marketing and Salesand\ntesting your communication with various targets can help better define your customer.\nManagement Failure\nThese are some typical management challenges that can prove detrimental.\n• Passion wanes or not the right business. Sometimes the reason a business fails is due to a simple reason:\nThe founder has lost excitement over the business and is no longer interested in making it succeed. Other\ntimes, the problem may stem from not having the right focus or idea, which can come from a lack of\nawareness about trends in the market. JoelDelgado, a young entrepreneur who started El Paso’s first\nescape room calledEl Paso Disaster Room 915in 2015, developed this business with three of his friends\nright after college. Although the business was very well received by young people who wanted this new\nform of entertainment, a few years later, he decided to close down the business and pursue a career in\nteaching. His passion had waned. Sometimes, entrepreneurs get bored with their startup, but there are\nways to keep the business exciting by changing the product offerings.\n• Fighting founders. Not agreeing over the strategies and direction of a business can deter companies from\nmoving forward. If the founders are not working together and disagree too much, this can help dissolve\nthe business quickly. Differing points of view can be healthy for a business, as these can bring other\ncomplementing perspectives, but when conflict doesn’t get resolved, it can be difficult to continue moving\nforward. Some business partners have found themselves ousted by their business partners because the\nrelationships have suffered a deep strain. This happened to SteveJobsin 1985 when he was let go by his\nown company. Often, it is difficult to assess when conflict will arise, so it is recommended that business\npartners work with people who have the same love for the business and its core values, even if they bring\ndifferent strengths and temperaments to the table. This may reduce fights and sustain relationships.\nHaving a contract in place that defines who is in charge of what part of the business, their compensation,\nand what happens if anyone departs, is a good way to ensure that the investment won’t be lost if partners\ndecide to part ways.\n• Lack of planning. One of the surest roads to failure is to not have a business plan or marketing plan. Even\nusing the lean startup method requires some sort of planning before embarking on the process. Planning\nhelps business owners flesh out ideas and understand the business better. Following thebusiness planin\nBusiness Model and Planand themarketing planinEntrepreneurial Marketing and Salescan help solidify\nwhere the business is headed, whether its viable, and what resources are required to make it work. For\nexample, imagine a business owner who opens a restaurant in an already-crowded market only to realize\nhow much competition existed in the area. If the owner had researched and planned ahead, the venture\ncould have been differentiated through the type of food offered, the location, or different promotional\ntactics to build clientele. Failure to plan in a situation like this can result in struggling to keep afloat and\ncan lead to successive challenges. For example, the owner might raise prices to compensate for lower-\nthan-expected revenue, but higher prices may drive away an already fragile customer base, and the\nventure may not be sustainable.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 10 Launch for Growth to Success 407\nFinancial Failure\nCash flow, debt, and capital are just some of the many financial factors that play a large role in startup success\nor failure.\n• Lack of cash. Lacking cash to operate the business can trample its operations and lead to a quick decline.\nIf there is nocash flow, it can also indicate that perhaps the business model is not working. For example,\nconsider our fictional restaurant owner. A lack of customers means a lack of cash flowing in as revenue.\nLoans can provide some assistance while working to build the clientele, but loans can go only so far. If the\nbusiness doesn’t grow and develop a sustainable cash flow, its ability to operate will come to an end.\n• Too much debt. Significantdebtcan hurt a business because it needs to pay back its lenders. In the\nprevious example, if the restaurant owner takes on too much debt, it may struggle to pay it back due to its\nlack of cash flow.\n• Lack of capital. Not having sufficientcapitalcan deter the business from expanding or even from meeting\ncustomer demand. Having a clear business plan can help determine the financial requirements, which are\nthe estimated sales and profits required for the successful attainment of goals. Financing for the business\ncan come from an entrepreneur’s own savings, bank loans, investors, and even friends and family. Having\nthe right funding to start or grow a business can make or break the business. For instance, our restaurant\nowner would need enough capital to invest in kitchen equipment, appliances, and furniture to start the\nbusiness. Undercapitalization in a startup could shut the business down before it even gets up and\nrunning. Once the business is running, ensuring that financial goals are met through metrics such as\nsales and profits can help prevent shortages of cash flow, which is essential to keeping a business alive.\nInnovation Failure\nInnovationcan be tricky because it requires creativity, risk, and often some subjectivity, taking into\nconsideration feelings and intuition in decision making. Lack of innovation and missteps in innovation can be\nobstacles to success.\n• Lack of innovation or failing to change effectively. Companies that don’t change their strategies, technology,\nor products run the risk of jeopardizing the business. Similarly, those that do change but not with the\nright adjustments risk failure. Thebuild-measure-learn loopcan help avoid these pitfalls by discerning\nwhat consumers really want and need by asking for their feedback.\nBlockbuster, an instant hit out of the gates in the 1980s, failed to innovate, or pivot its business model, and\nwent out of business. The video store revolutionized the media and movie industry by displaying empty boxes\nof its titles on shelves categorized by genre (the VHS tapes were kept behind the counter) and keeping late\nhours for night owls and last-minute weekenders wanting to catch a flick. Using a computer system to track\nvideos as they were rented, most of its profit was made by the fees charged for late movie returns. In 1987, the\ncompany was bought by WayneHuizenga, an American entrepreneur who owned several businesses in\ndifferent industries and who developed Blockbuster into a successful business by modelingMcDonald’s\napproach. The enterprise grew from twenty locations to over 9,000 locations. Blockbuster was then acquired in\n1993 by media giantViacomin an intricate transaction. As streaming and related technology entered the\nmarket, Blockbuster failed to innovate by not making necessary pivots to its delivery of entertainment and so\ncould not compete with new technology. Over the ensuing decade, it became more common to see\nBlockbuster stores with “store closing” banners, as shown inFigure10.7, than it did to see a thriving store.\nThere were other reasons why Blockbuster failed. Embedded with the lack of technology was the lack of\nfostering a culture of creativity from all of its employees, which hindered innovation. It lacked visionary\n\n408 Chapter 10 Launch for Growth to Success\nleadership. It needed a culture of collaboration and teamwork to facilitate communication with stakeholders,\nsuch as employees, customers, and upper administration. Finally, it closed all but one of its stores in 2013.[28]\nBy then, Netflix had completely changed the landscape of digital streaming services and left Blockbuster\nwithout a ticket to the show.\nFigure 10.7 Blockbuster failed to change its distribution channel to cater to new generations of movie\nwatchers.

More importantly, competitive analysis helps the entrepreneur\ndevelop a competitive edge that will help create a sustainable revenue stream. For example, a big company\nlikeWalmartprimarily competes on price. Small companies typically cannot compete on price, since the\ninternal efficiencies and volume sales available to large corporations like Walmart are not available to small\ncompanies, but they may be able to compete successfully against Walmart on some other important variable\nsuch as better service, better-quality products, or unique buying experiences.\nWhen preparing the competitive analysis, be sure to identify your competitors by product line or service\nsegment. For an entrepreneur, this activity can be difficult when the industry does not yet exist. In the case of\nBee Love,Palms Barberdidn’t have direct competitors, but she did have related competitors of traditional skin\ncare products. Her unique idea of all-natural, honey-based skin care products created a new market. The\ncompetitive analysis might need to focus on substitute products rather than direct competitors. There are two\nmain tools used in analysis of competitors: a competitive analysis grid and the “three circles” approach.\nCompetitive Analysis Grid\nThecompetitive analysis gridshould identify your competitors and include an assessment of the key\ncharacteristics of the competitive landscape in your industry, including competitive strengths and weaknesses\nand key success factors.\nTable 5.2provides an example of what a competitive analysis might look like for a bicycle shop in a tourist\nlocale.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 5 Identifying Entrepreneurial Opportunity 205\nCompetitive Analysis Grid for Sid’s Cycle Shop in Branson, Missouri\nKey Sid’s Cycle City Cycle SpokeMasters Target\nCharacteristics\nStrengths Product knowledge, Repair service High quality, Price, hours (open\nRepair service Top brands seven days per\nweek and online)\nWeaknesses Limited selection Poor customer Pricing, no Low-end quality, no\nservice entry-level repair facilities\nproducts\nProduct Quality Low-middle Middle-high High-end Entry-level\nLevel\nPrice Point Middle Middle-high High price Lowest price\nLocation of the Suburban strip-mall Outskirts of town Downtown side Branson Mall\nbusiness on busy highway on route 280 street\nPromotion Weekly ad in local Advertising in local Sponsors major Advertises online\nnewspaper, some paper during bike race in and in Sunday\nradio and Internet/ season, Internet/ area, Internet, newspaper\nsocial media social media social media (seasonally),\nInternet)\nTable 5.2This competitive analysis grid captures some of the main aspects of competitors within a given\nmarket.\nAs you complete an analysis for your venture’s competitors, identify what contributes to the competitor’s\nsuccess. In other words, why do people purchase from the company? Some possible reasons include no\nnearby competitors, lower prices than competitors, a wider variety of products, offering services not offered\nelsewhere, or branding and marketing that appeals to the target market. Your analysis should inform you of a\ncombination of key success factors within the industry (what it takes to be successful in the industry) and of\nwhat your competitors are not offering that is valued by your target market.\nAnother frequently used tool is aSWOT analysis(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats), which\nfocuses on analyzing your venture’s potential and builds on the knowledge gained from the competitive\nanalysis grid and the three circles. You will need to identify the strengths your venture will need to support the\ncompetitive advantage identified through the competitive analysis tools. The weaknesses can be identified\nbased on your current and foreseeable expectations. For a new venture, the opportunities and threats sections\nare based on current factors in the external environment that come from your research. In this context,\nopportunities are facts, changes, or situations within the external environment that could be favorably\nleveraged for the venture’s success.\n\n206 Chapter 5 Identifying Entrepreneurial Opportunity\nWORK IT OUT\nUsing SWOT Analysis to Evaluate Entrepreneurial Opportunity\nFigure 5.9 A SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and\nthreats of a potential entrepreneurial opportunity. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\nOne way to evaluate a business idea is to prepare a SWOT analysis (Figure5.9). Note that strengths and\nweaknesses are internal to the entrepreneur, while opportunities and threats are external factors.\nStrengths are capabilities and advantages of the entrepreneur, including education, experience, and\npersonal or professional contacts. Weaknesses are disadvantages of the entrepreneur, which could\ninclude lack of knowledge or experience. Opportunities are positive events that the entrepreneur can\ndevelop to his or her benefit. This could include development of new technologies, changes in consumer\ntastes and preferences, market growth, and new laws and regulations. Threats can be anything that\ncould potentially harm the business or prevent the business from becoming successful such as\ncompetition, negative changes in economic conditions, and new laws or regulations.\n• If you were starting a new business venture, what strengths would you be able to leverage to help\nyour business be successful?\n• Provide some examples of personal or professional weaknesses an entrepreneur might face when\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 5 Identifying Entrepreneurial Opportunity 207\nstarting a new business.\n• Discuss three occurring events such as new laws and regulations, changes in consumer tastes and\npreferences, or developing new technologies that could provide business opportunity for a new\nbusiness venture.\nAnother tool that can be used to analyze opportunities and threats section is calledPEST analysis(political,\neconomic, societal, technology). In this analysis, we identify issues in each of these categories.Figure5.10\nshows an example of the topics that could be placed in a PEST analysis. The chapter onFundamentals of\nResource Planningdiscusses this tool as it relates to resource procurement.\nFigure 5.10 A PEST analysis can help identify opportunities and threats that can be used in a SWOT analysis.\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nEach of these categories should be completed with relevant facts related to your entrepreneurial opportunity.\nAfter completing this analysis, you then determine if these facts, or factors, would be placed in the opportunity\nsection or the threat section of the SWOT."

      "reference_material_content": "238 Chapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques\nDesign Thinking\n6.3\nDavidKelley, founder of Stanford University’s Design School and cofounder of design companyIDEO, is\ncredited as the originator of design thinking, at least within business and entrepreneurial contexts. You were\nbriefly introduced to design thinking inCreativity, Innovation, and Invention, but we will delve into it in more\ndepth here. IDEO grew from a merger of the creator ofApple’s first mouse and the first laptop computer\ndesigner,David Kelley DesignandID Two, respectively. Almost a decade after the 1982 Apple creations, the\n1991-merged company primarily focused on the traditional design of products, ranging from toothbrushes to\nchairs. Yet another decade later, the company found itself designing consumer experiences more so than\nconsumer products. Kelley began using the word “thinking” to describe the design process involved in\ncreating customer experiences rather than creating physical products. The termdesign thinkingwas born.\nThe current IDEO CEO TimBrowndefines design thinking as “a human-centered and collaborative approach to\nproblem-solving, using a designed mindset to solve complex problems.”[21]Design thinkingis a method to\nfocus the design and development decisions of a product on the needs of the customer, typically involving an\nempathy-driven process to define complex problems and create solutions that address those problems.\nA common core of design thinking is its application beyond the design studio, as the methods and tools have\nbeen articulated for use by those outside of the field, particularly business managers. Design practice is now\nbeing applied beyond product and graphic areas to the design of digital interactions, services, business\nstrategy, and social policy.\nDesign Thinking Process\nBusiness schools have typically taught a rational, analytic approach to thinking. It focuses on well-defined\ngoals and constraints, and thought precedes action in a sequential process of planning and analysis. The\ndesign thinking process approaches problem solving differently. Thinking and doing are often intertwined in\nan iterative exploration of the design “space,” and the process uncovers goals and constraints, rather than\n21 Mark Logan. “Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs.”Medium. September 29, 2018. https://medium.com/idealect/design-thinking-for-\nentrepreneurs-392c8cbdcc24\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques 239\nidentifying them up front.\nOne design thinking approach that is taught at places like Stanford’s Design School and organizations like the\nLUMA Institute(a global company that teaches people how to be innovative) ishuman-centered design\n(HCD). HCD, as the name suggests, focuses on people during design and development. This speaks to the Tim\nBrown definition of design thinking. Inspiration for ideas comes from exploration of actual people, their needs\nand problems.\nFigure 6.14 The design thinking process focuses on the spaces of inspiration, ideation, and implementation.\n(credit (left): modification of “thought idea innovation imagination” by “TeroVesalainen”/Pixabay, CC0; credit\n(center): modification of “document paper business chart” by “rawpixel”/Pixabay, CC0; credit (right):\nmodification of “office business colleagues meeting” by “Free-Photos”/Pixabay, CC0)\nThree spaces—inspiration, ideation, and implementation—compose thedesign thinking process(Figure6.14).\nThe process uses “spaces” and not “phases” because multiple spaces can happen simultaneously.\nNevertheless, inspiration usually occurs first. This entails identifying a problem or opportunity that motivates\nsomeone to search for solutions.Ideationis the process of generating ideas and solutions through various\ntechniques such as brainstorming and sketching sessions. There are hundreds of ideation techniques\navailable. A few examples of ideation exercises include Top Five, How Might We, Mash-up, and Co-Creation\nSession. In Top Five, everyone on the team writes down their top five ideas, shares them, and clusters similar\nideas. In How Might We, the team looks at insight statements and reframes them as “How Might We”\nquestions by adding that phrase at the beginning. The goal is to find opportunities for design that also allows\nfor a variety of solutions. Mash-up involves combining existing brands or concepts to create something new.\nThe team identifies those brands or concepts that represent a quality they desire in their solution, and they\n“mash up” those ideas to create a new idea. A co-creation session incorporates the desired market into the\ncreation process by recruiting a group of people from the market to work on the design with the team. The\ngoal is to capture the feedback the group provides by treating them as designers, not as interview subjects.\nImplemented solutions evolve from interactions with users and from the ongoing creation and refinement of\npossible solutions. Design thinking incorporates experience-based insights, judgments, and intuition from the\nend users’ perspectives, while in a rational analytic approach, the solution process often becomes formalized\ninto a set of rules.\n\n240 Chapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques\nNestais a UK-based innovation foundation that offers many design thinking tools and resources similar to\nIDEO. Named for the acronym NESTA, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, the\norganization was established in 1998 with an endowment from the UK National Lottery and became an\nindependent charity in 2012. Nesta’s strategy focuses on health, government innovation, education, arts, and\ncreative economy and innovation policy. Nesta offers a set of five criteria to ascertain that an occupation is\ncreative:[22]\n1. Novel process\n2. Mechanization resistant\n3. Nonrepetitive or nonuniform function\n4. Makes a creative contribution to the value chain\n5. Involves interpretation not merely a transformation in the service or artifact\nAs the name implies, design thinking originates from design. As design is one of the identified creative\nindustries, there’s a clear connection between creative industries and design thinking. In fact, Nesta offers\ninspiration and ideation exercises that are freely available for users wishing to implement design thinking\npractices.\nHuman-Centered Design Thinking Spaces\nTheStanford Design Schooluses human-centered design thinking (HCD) as its design thinking approach. HCD\nemphasizes the following spaces of the design thinking process:\n• Empathizing: As illustrated by the human-centered approach, it is important to have empathy for the\nproblem you are attempting to solve. Empathy, as the chapter onCreativity, Innovation, and Invention\ndefined, means observing and immersing yourself in the surrounding environment to engage with and\nunderstand people’s experiences and motivations.\n• Defining: This aspect involves describing the core problem(s) that you and your team have identified.\nAsking “how might we?” questions helps narrow the focus, as the ultimate aim here is to identify a\nproblem statement that illustrates the problem you want to tackle. “Frame Your Design” is one such\nchallenge in whatIDEOcalls its “toolkit” that works well here. Frame Your Design asks you to write down\nyour problem and then refine it by following specific steps so that you end up with a design question that\nserves as a starting point but leaves room for creativity.[23]\n• Ideating: This is where you begin to come up with ideas that address the problem “space” you have\ndefined. There are hundreds of exercises aimed at the ideation process, ranging from brainstorming to\n“Five whys?” in the IDEO toolkit. The “Five whys” is a questioning method in which the researcher, in\nlooking for information to solve a problem, asks a respondent a broad question, then asks “why” to get\ndeeper into the respondent’s thinking. IDEO puts it this way: “You’ll use this method while you’re\nconducting an interview and start with really broad questions like “Do you save much money?” or “How\nwas your harvest this year?” Then, by asking why five times you’ll get some essential answers to\ncomplicated problems. This can be a great method to use if you’re trying to get at the human and\nemotional roots of a problem.”[24]\n• Prototyping: In this space, the entrepreneur creates and tests inexpensive, scaled-down versions of a\n22 Christine Harris, Margaret Collins, and Dennis Cheek.

      "reference_material_content": "Chapter 11 Business Model and Plan 453\nDesigning the Business Model\n11.2\nAccording to AlexanderOsterwalderand YvesPigneur, the authors ofBusiness Model Generation, a business\nmodel “describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers and captures value.” Nevertheless,\nthere is no single definition of this term, and usage varies widely.[29]\nIn standard business usage, abusiness modelis a plan for how venture will be funded; how the venture\ncreates value for its stakeholders, including customers; how the venture’s offerings are made and distributed\nto the end users; and the how income will be generated through this process. The business model refers more\nto the design of the business, whereas abusiness planis a planning document used for operations.\nEach business model is unique to the company it describes. A typical business model addresses the\ndesirability, feasibility, and viability of a company, product, or service. At a bare minimum, a business model\nneeds to address revenue streams (e.g., a revenue model), a value proposition, and customer segments. In\nnon-jargon English, this means you want to address what your idea is, who will use it, why they will use it, and\nhow you will make money off it.\n29 Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur.Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers.Hoboken,\nNJ: Wiley, 2010.\n\n454 Chapter 11 Business Model and Plan\nA canvas is a display that would-be entrepreneurs commonly use to map out and plan different components of\ntheir business models. There are several different types of canvases, with the business model canvas and the\nlean canvas being the most commonly used. There are hard-copy canvases modeled after an art canvas as well\nas digital versions. The original physical canvases are meant to serve as visual tools, used with sticky notes and\nsketches.\nAs developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur, thebusiness model canvashas nine components, as shown in\nFigure11.6.\nFigure 11.6 The business model canvas can be used to map or lay out the initial concept of your business.\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nOsterwalder and Pigneur wrote Value Proposition Design as a sequel to Business Model Generation. Their value\nproposition canvas is a plug-in that complements the business model canvas, going in depth on activities such\nas encouraging entrepreneurs to address and tackle customer pains, gains, and jobs-to-be-done trigger\nquestions, and designing pain relievers and gains. The complementary and accompanying activities and\nresources can be useful for a deeper dive into and understanding of customer value creation in the form of\nvalue proposition, although there are other approaches to conceptualizing your value proposition. For\nChristensen, the originator of the disruptive innovation and jobs-to-be-done theories, a value proposition is a\nproduct that helps customers do a job they’ve been trying to do more effectively, conveniently, and affordably.\nFinding the intersection of your customers’ problems and your solutions is how you create a unique value\nproposition, according to the entrepreneur Ash Maurya, the author of Scaling Lean and Running Lean. In\nRunning Lean, Maurya offers the following formula for creating an initial value proposition in the canvas, as\nshown in Figure 11.7.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 11 Business Model and Plan 455\nFigure 11.7 Maurya’s formula to determine value proposition considers customer needs and potential\nobjections within a specific period of time.

The original is freely available under the terms of\nthe CC BY 4.0 license athttps://press.rebus.community/media-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/.\n\n458 Chapter 11 Business Model and Plan\ncanvasis a new tool that pulls out the customer segment and value proposition blocks of the business model\ncanvas, and encourages more in-depth exploration of those blocks to achieve a good fit between the two. The\nvalue proposition canvas tool looks at customer pains, gains and jobs to be done on the customer side and\npainkillers, gain creators, and products and services on the value proposition side.[36]\nWhen you peel away the language used to describe business models, the early startup planning stages come\ndown to a series of questions. When it comes to formulating a business model for a startup concept, another\npopular framework used in entrepreneurial circles is that of desirability-feasibility-viabilityFigure11.10). This\nframework forces the entrepreneur to address broad questions about the startup concept:\n• Desirability: How desirable is the product? Who will use it and why?\n• Feasibility: How feasible is this idea? What are the costs of making it? How practical is the concept?\n• Viability: Will this idea remain viable? How will it make money? How will it be sustained over time?\nThese questions then begin to connect to form a narrative about where the startup concept came from, whom\nit serves, why it’s needed, how it will make money, and how it will be sustained in the future.\nFigure 11.10 The framework of desirability, feasibility, and viability form a story about a company’s startup.\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nThe value propositions, customer relationships, customer segments, and channels address the assumptions\nthat will createcustomer value(desirability). The cost structure and revenue stream blocks are aimed at\nviability, or overcoming flawed business models. The key partners, key activities, and key resources are about\nexecution and address feasibility. The risk of poor execution can undermine your assumptions that you chose\nthe right infrastructure to execute your business model (feasibility). The risk of solving an irrelevant customer\njob (sometimes derisively labeled “a solution in search of a problem”) undercuts desirability in your business.\nThe risk of a flawed business model would hamper the financial assumption that your business will earn more\nmoney than you spend (viability). Adaptability is about the assumption that you chose the right business\n36 Michelle Ferrier and Elizabeth Mays.Media Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

The external threats not specifically covered by the\ncanvas blocks can be designed for adaptability, that is, the business model canvas is a necessary but\ninsufficient component of determining the viability of the business idea/concept. There are many elements not\nincluded in the canvas that entrepreneurs must address. Industry analysis, including a competitive analysis,\nfor example, falls “off canvas” but is important nonetheless.\n37 Jennifer van der Meer. \"Do You Suffer from Value Proposition Confusion?\"Linkedin.

Most of these approaches have had to do with the entrepreneur’s cognitive or creative\nmindsets. Now we will learn about an approach that is more rooted in process, calledlean process. Lean\nproblem solving has been used as an entrepreneurial methodology in new and emerging ventures, and it’s\ninteresting that it comes from a large corporate, manufacturing background that focuses on efficiencies. The\nSix Sigmamethodology, pioneered atMotorolain the 1970s and 1980s, and adopted by many companies, is a\ndisciplined, data-driven approach that provides companies tools to improve the capability of their business\nprocesses. According to the American Society for Quality, “Six Sigma views all work as processes that can be\ndefined, measured, analyzed, improved and controlled. A set of qualitative and quantitative tools is used to\ndrive process improvement. This increase in performance and decrease in process variation helps lead to\ndefect reduction and improvement in profits, employee morale, and quality of products or services.”[26]GE\ncopied it and created the “Process Excellence” programs that millions of managers and others have taken to\nget certified at various “belts.” Although Six Sigma and Process Excellence do not fit strictly in terms of\nentrepreneurship, as they are used mainly by large, mature companies, many of the methods fit in the lean\nmodel.\nToyotapioneered the lean process in the 1980s. The term “lean manufacturing” is the most common, but it is\nmuch more than manufacturing. Thelean processis a systematic method for the maximizing of continuous\nimprovement and the minimization of surplus or unused material in the production of a process. The\nentrepreneur begins the startup with a sense the original product will be the product carrying the\norganization to success in the long term. In most cases, the good or service will require modification to\nmaintain a process, technology, or up-to-date product offering. Lean problem solving means the\nentrepreneur’s entire team scans both the company’s internal and external environments for continuous\nimprovement and methods for bringing additional revenue to the startup by cost improvement processes that\npromote sustainable value. Theexternal environmentencompasses customers, industry trends, and\ncompetition. Theinternal environmentcomprises the factors inside the enterprise, such as employees, and\ninternal practices and processes. In lean manufacturing, for example, improving efficiencies in the internal\nenvironment should lead to advantages in the external environment (whether that be cost savings to\ncustomers, competitive advantage from more output/superior product, etc.).\nFor example, every mile saved per day perUPStruck driver results in approximately $50 million in savings per\nyear, according to Juan Perez, the company’s chief information and engineering officer. Using customer data\nand artificial intelligence, the company created a system dubbed ORION, which is an acronym for On-Road\nIntegrated Optimization and Navigation.[27]To date, the system has resulted in $400 million in savings to UPS.\nBy applying the lean process, everything that UPS saves on the input (by reducing mileage) leads to savings on\nthe output, which leads faster deliveries, lower costs for consumers, and more profit for UPS.\n26 American Society for Quality. “What Is Six Sigma?” n.d. https://asq.org/quality-resources/six-sigma\n27 Juan Perez. “UPS’ Approach to Innovation and Technology.” Presentation sponsored by J. Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia\nState University, Atlanta, GA. March 28, 2019.\n\n244 Chapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques\nLean Problem-Solving Process\nThelean problem-solving processis a cycle of observation, assessment, and continual evaluation. As shown in\nTable 6.1, this cycle typically involves eight specific steps.\nSteps in the Toyota Lean Problem-Solving Process\nStep Action\nStep1 Clarify the problem.\nStep2 Analyze the problem (genchi genbutsu is the Toyota practice of thoroughly understanding a\ncondition by confirming information or data through personal observation at the source of the\ncondition; the Japanese phrase essentially means “go and see”).[28]\nStep3 Set targets.\nStep4 Identify root causes. Asking, “Why?” repeatedly can narrow down the factors to a root cause.\nStep5 Develop countermeasures by asking, “What is the specific change we want to make?” and\ninvolving others in the problem-solving process.\nStep6 Implement the countermeasures and see them through.\nStep7 Monitor results.\nStep8 Standardize processes that succeed. Lean problem solving is about learning more about the\nproblem itself and its deep causes in context.\nTable 6.1The lean problem-solving, step-wise process allows the business to observe, assess, and continually\nevaluate.\n28 “Genchi Genbutsu.”Lean HE Glossary. n.d. http://www.leanhe.org/lean-he/glossary#TOC-Genchi-Genbutsu\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9\n\nChapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques 245\nLean Problem-Solving Phases\nObservationis the phase in which the entrepreneur studies the challenge and notes all facets of the challenge\nrequiring solution. In this phase, the entrepreneur asks questions and conducts research about the change\nneeded for a successful product, outcome, or service. The entrepreneurs must determine why the change is\nneeded. What is the purpose of the endeavor? Feedback is extremely important in this phase.\nFor example, a community asked a group of entrepreneurs to help address the youth obesity problem in a\nmiddle school. The entrepreneurs began to study the intake of food by the children and determined that both\nthe content of the school lunch menu and the lifestyle of the majority of the children were affecting the obesity\nrate in the community. They then defined the purpose of the project as finding a low-cost, low-risk method of\nchanging the lunch menu and agreed that the primary outcome would be a 30 percent reduction in the\nobesity rate of the children. The entrepreneurs began to assess the cost of changing the lunch menu and\nobserving what else the kids ate. The entrepreneurs discovered that the lunch menu change required to\nreduce the obesity rate was beyond the financial capability of the school district. Research also showed that\nmany of the children, products of single-parent homes, were eating high-calorie, high-fat, take-out foods for\ndinner. Further observation revealed that the children did not engage in physical activity after hours because\nthe local surroundings were not safe. The community needed a process to transform the wellness of the\nchildren, and the entrepreneurs recommended using a lean process approach to help the children as quickly\nas possible.\nAfter the observation of the problem comesassessment, the phase in which the entrepreneur experiments\nand analyzes the potential process and its capabilities. The entrepreneur leverages creative tools and\nresources to arrive at a solution and assesses each step of a possible solution. Each step must add value to the\nsolution, or that step in the solution is unnecessary. In addition, the step must be capable of solving the issue\nand add flexibility to the solution. How is the process or product being improved? In this phase, a prototype of\nthe product is developed and delivered. The entrepreneur must ask the customer if all needs and wants are\nsatisfied with the prototype. If the prototype is being developed for mass production, surveying customers\nabout potential sales is essential. In the school lunch example, the school system would have been the\ncustomer of the new food menu (prototype) in the assessment phase.\nEvaluationis the phase in which behaviors are analyzed to assess success. The entrepreneur continually\nstudies each phase of the solution to observe the effectiveness of outcomes desired by the client. The\nentrepreneur ensures that transformation is built into the habits of the school to obtain, maintain, and\ndevelop the desired outcomes.\nIn a real-world example of a company applying lean processes, theNew Balance Company, which designs and\nmanufactures both athletic and casual shoes, used a batching approach in the early 2000s that organized\nproduction by departments, so that all of the cutting took place in one department, all of the stitching took\nplace in another, and so forth. While it seems that batching tasks would improve efficiency, at New Balance, it\nmeant that production of one pair of shoes took nine days. Executives observed piles of inventory sitting\nbetween floors and departments, and noticed employees waiting while there were delays in the production\nline. They also noticed that the pay structure contributed to the piles of works in process because employees\nwere paid by the piece, which encouraged them to produce as much as possible.\nThe company applied lean principles to rearrange the production floor by value streams, or the making of a\nproduct by sharing similar processing steps. On one side was “cut and stitch” products using US materials of\nleather and mesh, while another side used premade products from overseas for soles, inserts, and kits. This\nchange cut the time to make a pair of shoes down to four hours, meaning that domestic plants could ship\nsome orders in twenty-four hours, while competitors may need as much as 121 days to ship when they\n\n246 Chapter 6 Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques\noutsourced manufacturing to Asia.\nAn often-used lean problem-solving tool is whiteboarding (Figure6.16).Whiteboardingis a type of graphing\nthat permits the entrepreneur to plot each step in a process to build comprehension and detailing of the\nprocess. The entrepreneur draws each step on the whiteboard using a linking-type diagram, and draws arrows\nto show how processes affect other processes. Seeing the flow of the process allows the entrepreneur to note\nwhere functions in the process are duplicated or inconsistent.\nFigure 6.16 Whiteboarding is a technique that can help entrepreneurs visualize and analyze processes.\n(credit: “whiteboard man presentation write” by “StartupStockPhotos”/Pixabay, CC0)\nFor example, in a community garden, storing tools, such as hoes and hand trowels for weeding, in different\nsheds wastes time when preparing to begin the process of weeding. These tools should be stored collectively\nto eliminate multiple trips and wasted time. Seeing the process on a whiteboard or other medium brings\nawareness to how processes can be improved. After the process is changed, it is graphed again for further\nscrutiny.\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at https://cnx.org/content/col29104/1.9"

Point A in the figure\nshows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus\ntickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then,\nhowever, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero\nburgers).\nIf we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the\ncombination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget\namount.\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers.\nThat is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point\non (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any\npoint outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his\nbudget.\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.\nSuppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost\nAlphonso for one more burger? It woulbde natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think.\nInstead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying\nwithin his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more\nburger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.\nThe Concept of Opportunity Cost\nEconomists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what people must give up to obtain what they desire.\nThe idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume\nsomething else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the\nopportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to\nchoose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone\nalternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they\nhave to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.\n© I\n\n30 2+ Choice ina World of Scarcity\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your\neconomics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your\nincome on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the\nopportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis ofa budget constraint calculation. Read\nthrough it to understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix The Use\nof Mathematics in Principles of Economics.\nWORK IT T\nUnderstanding Budget Constraints\nBudget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in\nPrinciples of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your\nstrength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.\nStep 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:\nBudget =P; X Q; + P, X Q,\nwhere P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and\nBudget is the amount of income one has to spend.\nStep 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:\nBudget=P;x Q,+ P, X Q,\n$10 budget=$2 per burger X quantity of burgers + $0.50 per bus ticket X quantity of bus tickets\n$10=82 X Qpurgers + $0-50 X Qpus tickets\nStep 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:\ny =b+mx\nFor Alphonso, this is:\n$10 = $2 X Qpurgers *+ $0.50 X Qpus tickets\nStep 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n2% 10 =2 X 2 X Qpurgers + 2 X 0.5 X Qbus tickets\n20 = 4 X Qvurgers + 1 X Qbus tickets\nStep 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:\n20 — Qpus tickets =4 X Qburgers\nDivide each side by 4 to yield the answer:\n5 = 0.25 X Qpus tickets = Qburgers\nor\nQburgers =5 = 0.25 X Qpus tickets\nStep 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope\nis —0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug\nother numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 2.1), which are the points on\nAlphonso’s budget constraint.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n2.1« How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 31\nPoint Quantity of Burgers (at $2) Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)\nA 5 0\nB 4 4\nc 3 8\nD 2 12\nE 1 16\nF 0 20\nTABLE 2.1\nStep 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on\nthe horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is —0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up\n1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.\nThere are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that\nthe only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of\nbus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the\nvertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the\ntwo prices.\nIdentifying Opportunity Cost\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for\n$300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has forsaken. For practical purposes,\nthere may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought\nwith that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true\nopportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team\nspirit.” The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the\nretreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the\ntwo days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket\ncosts of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition,\nduring the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus,\ncollege imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety.\nFor example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel inconspicuously with\nthe rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year.\n\n32 2+ Choice ina World of Scarcity\nRetrofittianlgl U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harfor dterreorirsts to take over the plane would\nhavea price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment fora irports, like three-dimensional\nbaggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\nHowever, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity\ncost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),\nthere were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the\n9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than\nin the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists\ncommonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air\ntravelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air\ntravelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports\ncould be as much as 800 million x 0.5 hours x $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of\nwaiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\nIn some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on\nlunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a\nday, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs\nminus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much.\nHowever, if you project what that adds up to in a year—250 days a year x $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,\nperhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,”\nyou might make different choices.\nAccess for free at openstax.org"

      "reference_material_content": "9.1+ How Monopolies Form: Barriers toEntry 219\n9.1 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDistinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.\nExplain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources led to the necessary formation of legal\nmonopolies\nAnalyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting innovation\nIdentify examples of predatory pricing\nBecause of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant economic profits. These profits should\nattract vigorous competition as we described in Perfect Competition, and yet, because of one particular\ncharacteristic of monopoly, they do not. Barriers to entry are the legal, technological, or market forces that\ndiscourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market. Barriers to entry can range from the\nsimple and easily surmountable, such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive. For\nexample, there are a finite number of radio frequencies available for broadcasting. Once an entrepreneur or\nfirm has purchased the rights to all of them, no new competitors can enter the market.\nIn some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases, they may limit competition to a few\nfirms. Barriers may block entry even if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus, in\nmarkets with significant barriers to entry, it is not necessarily true that abnormally high profits will attract new\nfirms, and that this entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that surviving firms earn\nonly a normal level of profit in the long run.\nThere are five types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit.\nNatural Monopoly\nEconomies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition. (We introduced this theme in\nProduction, Costand Industry Structure). Figure 9.2 presents a long-run average cost curve for the airplane\nmanufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of Pg,\nthen constant returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies of scale at a quantity of\nproduction greater than 20,000 planes per year.\nNow consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC)\ncurve at an output level of 5,000 planes per year and at a price P1, which is higher than P. In this situation, the\nmarket has room for only one producer. If a second firm attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by\nproducing a quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than those of the existing firm, and it\nwill be unable to compete. If the second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000 planes per\nyear, then it could produce at a lower average cost—but it could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced\nbecause of insufficient demand in the market.\n\n220 9 +Monopoly\n()\ne LRAC\nc\ni\nr\nP\nt\nor !\n\"\n|\n|\ns |\no\nC\n|\n|\nDemand\n|\nI\nI\ni\n|\ni\nT T + T t\n4,000 6,0008,000 12,000 16,000 20,000\nOutput\nFIGURE 9.2 Economies of Scale and Natural MonopolyIn this market, the demand curve intersects the long-run\naverage cost (LRAC) curve at its downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity demanded is\nless than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve.\nEconomists call this situation, when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the\nmarket, a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of adding an\nadditional customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the overall system are in place. This results in situations\nwhere there are substantial economies of scale. For example, once a water company lays the main water pipes\nthrough a neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once the\nelectric company installs lines in a new subdivision, the marginal cost of providing additional electrical service\nto one more home is minimal. It would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the\nmarket and invest in a whole second set of main water pipes, or for a second electricity company to enter the\nmarket and invest in a whole new set of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where, because of\neconomies of scale, one producer can serve the entire market more efficiently than a number of smaller\nproducers that would need to make duplicate physical capital investments.\nA natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products that are difficult to transport. For\nexample, cement production exhibits economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in alocal area\nmay not be much larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover, the costs of transporting cement over\nland are high, and so a cement plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural\nmonopoly.\nControl of a Physical Resource\nAnother type of monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce physical resource. In the U.S.\neconomy, one historical example of this pattern occurred when ALCOA—the Aluminum Company of\nAmerica—controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used in making aluminum. Back in the\n1930s, when ALCOA controlled most of the bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough\naluminum to compete.\nAs another example, the majority of global diamond production is controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national\ncompany that has mining and production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It also\nhas exploration activities on four continents, while directing a worldwide distribution network of rough cut\ndiamonds. Although in recent years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the rough\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n9.1+ How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry 221\ndiamond market is still considerable.\nLegal Monopoly\nFor some products, the government erects barriers to entry by prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S.\nlaw, no organization but the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail. Many states or cities\nhave laws or regulations that allow households a choice of only one electric company, one water company, and\none company to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are utilities—products necessary for everyday\nlife—that are socially beneficial. As a consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated\nmonopolies, to ensure that customers have access to an appropriate amount of these products or services.\nAdditionally, legal monopolies are often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one\nprovider.\nPromoting Innovation\nInnovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company invests in research and development and\nfinds the cure for the common cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies could take\nthe formula, produce the drug, and because they did not incur the costs of research and development (R&D),\nundercut the price of the company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms would choose\nnot to invest in research and development, and as a result, the world would have less innovation. To prevent\nthis from happening, the Constitution of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8: “The Congress shall\nhave Power . . . to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors\nand Inventors the Exclusive Right to their Writings and Discoveries.” Congress used this power to create the\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the U.S. Copyright Office. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive\nlegal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time. In the United States, exclusive patent rights last\nfor 20 years. The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their\ninvestment in R&D, but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires.\nAtrademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or\nthe Nike “swoosh” that appears on shoes and athletic gear. Between 2003 and 2019, roughly 6.8 million\ntrademarks were registered with the U.S. government. A firm can renew a trademark repeatedly, as long as it\nremains in active use.\nA copyright, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, “is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United\nStates for ‘original works of authorship’ including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural, cartographic,\nchoreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and audiovisual creations.” No one can reproduce,\ndisplay, or perform a copyrighted work without the author's permission. Copyright protection ordinarily lasts\nfor the life of the author plus 70 years.\nRoughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects books, songs, and art. However, in\ncertain areas, like the invention of new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection\nshould apply. There is also a body of law known as trade secrets. Even if a company does not have a patent on\nan invention, competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the formula for\nCoca-Cola, which is not protected under copyright or patent law, but is simply kept secret by the company.\nTaken together, we call this combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law intellectual\nproperty, because it implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece of property like a\nhouse or a car. Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the\ntime periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are ongoing negotiations, both\nthrough the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring\ngreater harmony to the intellectual property laws of different countries to determine the extent to which those\nin other countries will respect patents and copyrights of those in other countries.\nGovernment limitations on competition used to be more common in the United States. For most of the\n\n222 9 +Monopoly\ntwentieth century, only one phone company—AT&T—was legally allowed to provide local and long distance\nservice. From the 1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations limited which destinations airlines could\nchoose to fly to and what fares they could charge. Another set of regulations limited the interest rates that\nbanks could pay to depositors; yet another specified how much trucking firms could charge customers.\n‘What products we consider utilities depends, in part, on the available technology. Fifty years ago, telephone\ncompanies provided local and long distance service over wires. It did not make much sense to have many\ncompanies building multiple wiring systems across towns and the entire country. AT&T lost its monopoly on\nlong distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and\nsatellite transmission, so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism. The same thing\nhappened to local service, especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.\nThe combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could\nprovide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the\n1990s. This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter, the prices that\nthey could charge, and the quantities that many industries could produce, including telecommunications,\nairlines, trucking, banking, and electricity.\nAround the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many governments continue to control\nand limit competition in what those governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks, steel\ncompanies, oil companies, and telephone companies.\n© I\n___________________________________|\nIntimidating Potential Competition\nBusinesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential\ncompetitors from entering the market. One method is known as predatory pricing, in which a firm uses the\nthreat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it\nis difficult to prove.\nConsider alarge airline that provides most of the flights between two particular cities. A new, small start-up\nairline decides to offer service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes prices on this\nroute to the bone, so that the new entrant cannot make any money. After the new entrant has gone out of\nbusiness, the incumbent firm can raise prices again.\nAfter the company repeats this pattern once or twice, potential new entrants may decide that it is not wise to\ntry to compete. Small airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early 2000s, for example,\nValuJet accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015,\nthe Justice Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing restrictions on retailers\nthat encouraged customers to use lower swipe fees on credit transactions.\nIn some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of discouraging the competition. If the only way\nto launch a successful new national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of Coca-Cola and\nPepsi Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.\nSumming Up Barriers to Entry\nTable 9.1 lists the barriers to entry that we have discussed. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved\nto be highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage competition. When barriers to entry exist,\nperfect competition is no longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers to entry are\nhigh enough, monopoly can result.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n9.2 « How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price\nBarrier to Entry Government Role?

You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and\nthen go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.” Table 22.1 compares some prices of common goods in\n1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of\nliving in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have\nevolved over recent decades.

However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and\nlook at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in Table 22.1—and all the price increases\nfor the other products in the economy—is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie\ntickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. At the beginning of 2021, $1 had about the\nsame purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 15 cents did in 1972, because of the amount\nof inflation that has occurred over that time period.\nItems 1970 2021\nPound of ground beef $0.66 $5.96\nPound of butter $0.87 $3.50\nMovie ticket $1.55 $13.70\nSales price of new home (median) $22,000 | $408,800\nNew car $3,000 | $42,000\nGallon of gasoline $0.36 $3.32\nAverage hourly wage for a manufacturing worker | $3.23 $30.11\nPer capita GDP $5,069 | $63,543\nTABLE 22.1 Price Comparisons, 1970 and 2021 (Sources: See chapter\nReferences at end of book.)\nMoreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, but wages and income levels, too. The\nsecond-to-last row of Table 22.1 shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased\nnearly ten-fold from 1970 to 2021. The average worker in 2021 is better educated and more productive than\nthe average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased substantially from\n1970 to 2021, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than twelve times better off in just 51\nyears? Not likely.\nA modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of\nsupply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate? As with many\nproblems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Economists\ncombine prices of a variety of goods and services into a single price level. The inflation rate is simply the\npercentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.\nThe Price of a Basket of Goods\nTo calculate the price level, economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services, consisting of\nthe different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the\nprices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall\nprice level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation,\nhowever, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.\nChanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than\nchanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an\nincrease of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots\nrises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the\n\n536 22 . Inflation\nprices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services\npeople buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of\ninflation based on a few products.\nWORK IT T\nCalculating an Annual Rate of Inflation\nConsider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in Table 22.2. Say that in any given\nmonth, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table\nprovides prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket\nmay rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies\nincrease in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost of buying the given basket of\ngoods at the prices prevailing at that time.\nItems Hamburger Aspirin Movies Total Inflation Rate\nQty 20 1 bottle | 5 = =\n(Pd 1) Price $3.00 $10.00 | $6.00 | - =\n(Pd 1) Amount Spent | $60.00 $10.00 | $30.00 | $100.00 | -\n(Pd 2) Price $3.20 $10.00 | $6.50 | - =\n(Pd 2) Amount Spent » $64.00 » $10.00 | $32.50 » $106.50 | 6.5%\n(Pd 3) Price $3.10 $10.00 | $7.00 | - =\n(Pd 3) Amount Spent | $62.00 $10.00 | $35.00 | $107.00 | 0.5%\n(Pd 4) Price $3.50 $10.00 | $7.50 | - =\n(Pd 4) Amount Spent » $70.00 » $10.00 | $37.50 » $117.50 | 9.8%\nTABLE 22.2 A College Student’s Basket of Goods\nTo calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:\nStep 1. Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasintghe overall basket of goods between the time\nperiods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or\nin any other calculation, is:\n(Level in new year — Level in previous year)\nLevel in previous year x 100 = Percentage change\nStep 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasintghe basket of goods in Table 22.2 rises from $100\nto $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time—the inflation rate—is:\n(106.5o0 — 100) = 0,065 = 6.5%\nStep 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasintghe basket rises from $106.50 to\n$107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:\n50— 00047 = 047%\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n22.1.« Tracking Inflation 537\nStep 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:\nU172501 010 7) _= 0.098 _= 9.8%\nThis calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student\nspends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced.\nIf an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that\ngood should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person’s money. The larger impact of hamburgers\nshows up in the “amount spent” row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the\namount spent row.\nIndex Numbers\nThe numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example\nin Table 22.2 has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If\nthe list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year\nmight be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.\nTo simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,\neconomists typically report the price level in each period as an index number, rather than as the dollar\namount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change\nin relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists\narbitrarily choose one year to be the base year, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices.\nThe base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a\nsimple math trick. In the example above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total\namount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this\nis because the index number in the base year always has to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values\nof the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note\nalso that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.\nTable 22.3 shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in Table 22.2.\nBecause we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost\nof purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the\npercentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be\n(99.5 2- 93.4) = 0,065 = 6.5%\nThis is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of\ngoods for the same time period.\nTotal Spending Index Number Inflation Rate Since Previous Period\nPeriNo d 1 | $100 T1o070 =_ 934\nPeriod 2 | $106.50 10650 995 | P3R4 — 0,065 = 6.5%\nPeri:o d 3 | $107 T1o077 _= 100.0 51009 -599. 5= =_ 0.005=- 0.5%\nPer:i od 4 | $117.50 o117. 50 =_ 1098 | g109 .- 810 0 =_ 0.098 =- 9.8%\nTABLE 22.3 Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year\n\n538 22 Inflation\nIf the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the\nindex numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance\nat two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years\nis about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute\ndollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and\n$20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about\n3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110\nas the previous example. If you're wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn’t work,\nread the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy do you not just subtract index numbers?\nA word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not exactly 3%.\nRemember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtractintghe index numbers, but rather through the percentage-\nchange calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as 100 x (110 —\n107)/107 =100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible\nshortcut to calculating the inflation rate—but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will\nnot give the right answer.\nTwo final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or\nother units attached to them. Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the\nindex numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we\nfind in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with the data.\nSecond, the choice of a base year for the index number—that is, the year that is automatically set equal to\n100—is arbitrary. We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official\ninflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base\nyear of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will\nresult in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base\nyear when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the\nindex numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be\n6.5%.\nNow that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure\nthe cost of living.\nAccess for free at openstax.org"

Positive Externalities and Public Goods\n13.3 Public Goods\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n« Identify a public good using nonexcludable and non-rival as criteria\n« Explain the free rider problem\n« Identify several sources of public goods\nEven though new technology creates positive externalities so that perhaps one-half or two-thirds of the social\nbenefit of new inventions spills over to others, the inventor still receives some private return. What about a\nsituation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of\nthe social benefit? We call this kind of good a public good. Spending on national defense is a good example of a\npublic good. Let’s begin by defining the characteristics of a public good and discussing why these\ncharacteristics make it difficult for private firms to supply public goods. Then we will see how government may\nstep in to address the issue.\nThe Definition of a Public Good\nEconomists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not necessarily include all goods financed\nthrough taxes. To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private\ngood, like a piece of pizza. We can buy and sell a piece of pizza fairly easily because it is a separate and\nidentifiable item. However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.\nInstead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are nonexcludable and non-rival. The first\ncharacteristic, that a public good is nonexcludable, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone\nfrom using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna,\nfrom eating that pizza. However, if national defense is provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly\ndisagree with America’s defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still\nprotects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and\nexclude you.\nThe second main characteristic of a public good, that it is non-rival, means that when one person uses the\npublic good, another can also use it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then Michelle\ncannot also eat it; that is, the two people are rivals in consumption. With a public good like national defense,\nMax’s consumption of national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so they are non-rival in\nthis area.\nA number of government services are examples of public goods. For instance, it would not be easy to provide\nfire and police service so that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning and\nburglary of their property, while others would not be protected at all. Protecting some necessarily means\nprotecting others, too.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n13.3 » Public Goods 319\nPositive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts. Public goods have positive externalities,\nlike police protection or public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive externalities, however,\nare public goods. Investments in education have huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private\ncompany. Private companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad and reap profits that may not\ncapture all of the social benefits. We can also describe patents as an attempt to make new inventions into\nprivate goods, which are excludable and rivalrous, so that no one but the inventor can use them during the\nlength of the patent.\nThe Free Rider Problem of Public Goods\nPrivate companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good or service is nonexcludable, like national\ndefense, so that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or service, then how can a\nfirm charge people for it?\n‘When individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a free rider problem can arise, in which people\nhave an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to “free ride” on the purchases of others. We\ncan express the free rider problem in terms of the prisoner’s dilemma game, which we discussed as a\nrepresentation of oligopoly in Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.\nThere is a dilemma with the Prisoner’s Dilemma, though. See the Work It Out feature.\nWORK IT OUT\nThe Problem with the Prisoner’s Dilemma\nSuppose two people, Rachel and Samuel, are considering purchasing a public good. The difficulty with the\nprisoner’s dilemma arises as each person thinks through their strategic choices.\nStep 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then I would be a fool to contribute. However,\nif Samuel does contribute, then I can come out ahead by not contributing.\nStep 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope that I can be a free rider who uses the\npublic good paid for by Samuel.\nStep 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.\nStep 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets built, and there is no movement to the\noption where everyone cooperates—which is actually best for all parties.\nThe Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods\nThe key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring that everyone will make a contribution\nand to prevent free riders. For example, if people come together through the political process and agree to pay\ntaxes and make group decisions about the quantity of public goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by\nrequiring, through the law, that everyone contributes.\nHowever, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. In some cases, markets\ncan produce public goods. For example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio signal is\nbroadcast, it would be very difficult to stop someone from receiving it. It is non-rival, since one person\nlistening to the signal does not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these features, it is practically\n\n320 13- Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nimpossible to charge listeners directly for listening to conventional radio broadcasts.\nRadio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which is an indirect way of “charging” listeners\nby taking up some of their time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also paying for\nthe radio service, since the station builds in the cost of advertising into the product cost. In a more recent\ndevelopment, satellite radio companies, such as SiriusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming\nmusic without commercials. In this case, however, the product is excludable—only those who pay for the\nsubscription will receive the broadcast.\nSome public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no charge along with fees for some purposes,\nlike a public city park thatis free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car, for reserving\ncertain picnic grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment stand.\nIn other cases, we can use social pressures and personal appeals, rather than the force of law, to reduce the\nnumber of free riders and to collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes form an\nassociation to carry out beautification projects or to patrol their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-\nincome countries, where social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate, farmers in a region\nmay come together to work on a large irrigation project that will benefit all. We can view many fundraising\nefforts, including raising money for local charities and for the endowments of colleges and universities, as an\nattempt to use social pressure to discourage free riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a public\nbenefit.\nCommon Resources and the “Tragedy of the Commons”\nThere are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of private good or public good. While it is easy\nto classify a pizza as a private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that is nonexcludable\nand rivalrous, such as the queen conch?\nIn the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk that lives in shallow waters of sea grass. These\nwaters are so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is\nconch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but artists use the large ornate shells and\ncraftsmen transform them. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can participate in the\nconch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous. Once a diver\ncatches one conch another diver cannot catch it.\n‘We call goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous common resources. Because the waters of the Caribbean\nare open to all conch fishermen, and because any conch that you catch is a conch that Icannot catch,\nfishermen tend to overharvest common resources like the conch.\nThe problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag\n“tragedy of the commons” to the problem in a 1968 article in the magazine Science. Economists view this as a\nproblem of property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no\none individual has an incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To address the issue of\noverharvesting conch and other marine fisheries, economists have advocated simple devices like fishing\nlicenses, harvest limits, and shorter fishing seasons. One approach that has been turned to more recently is\nthe implementation of catch shares, whereby regulators establish a total allowable catch, and then fishermen\nare allocated a portion of that total allowable catch. Catch shares appear to slow the race to fish. When the\npopulation of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until\nbiologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with the\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n13.3 « Public Goods 321\nconch, the harvesting of which the government has effectively banned in the United States since 1986.\nThe tragedy of the commons is a frequent economic and social framework for discussions about a range of\ncommon resources, even extending into digital resources such as open media repositories and online\nlibraries. Prominent economist Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics,\nproposed an alternate version, sometimes referred to as the \"non-tragedy of the commons.\" After extensive\nfieldwork in areas as diverse as Indonesia, Kenya, Maine (U.S.), and Nepal, she challenged the notion that\npeople would only avoid depletion of common resources if they were forced to by regulatory laws and property\nrights. She noted that farmers working shared land could communicate and cooperate in order to maximize\nand preserve the fields over time. She argued that when those who benefit most from a resource are in close\nproximity to it (like a farm field that directly serves a town), the resource is better managed without external\ninfluence.\n© I\n|\nPositive Externalities in Public Health Programs\nOne of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last several centuries is that people are\nliving longer. Scientists believe that, thousands of years ago, human life expectancy ranged between 20 to 30\nyears. By 1900, average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2015, life expectancy was 79\nyears; due to COVID-19, life expectancy declined slightly to 77 years in 2020. Most of the gains in life\nexpectancy in the history of the human race happened in the twentieth century.\nThe rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors. First, systems for providing clean water\nand disposing of human waste helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in public\nbehavior have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century, for example, people learned the importance of\nboiling bottles before using them for food storage and baby’s milk, washing their hands, and protecting food\nfrom flies. More recent behavioral changes include reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and\nprecautions to limit sexually transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role. Scientists\ndeveloped immunizations for diphtheria, cholera, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever between\n1890 and 1930. Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led to a series of other antibiotic drugs for bringing infectious\ndiseases under control. In recent decades, drugs that reduce the risks of high blood pressure have had a\ndramatic effect in extending lives.\nThese advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive externalities and public goods. Public\nhealth officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late\n1900s. Government funded many public sanitation systems and storm sewers because they have the key traits\nof public goods. In the twentieth century, many medical discoveries emerged from government or university-\nfunded research. Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private\ninventors. The reason for requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of\nillness to others—as well as helping the person immunized."

A recent report\nmight have said, for example, from September 2021 to October 2021, the U.S. unemployment rate declined\nfrom 4.8% to 4.6%. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However, remember\nthat the U.S. economy has about 162 million adults (as of the beginning of 2022) who either have jobs or are\nlooking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 162 million potential workers\ntranslates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York,\nBrownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job\nlosses. In April 2020, at the peak of the pandemic-induced recession, over 20 million people were out of work.\nEven with the unemployment rate at 4.2% in November 2021, about 7 million people who were looking for jobs\nwere out of work.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n21.1 « How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 507\n© I\n|\n]\nWho's In or Out of the Labor Force?\nShould we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count\nchildren as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college\nstudents have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the\npains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on\nparental leave.\nThe point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group\nexists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason—retirement, looking after children, taking a\nvoluntary break before a new job—are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want\na job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.\nEconomists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor\nforce or not in the labor force.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,\nasks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.\nTo be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively\nlooking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently\navailable to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.\nEmployed: currently working for pay\nUnemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job\nOut of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job\nLabor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed\nCalculating the Unemployment Rate\nFigure 21.2 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In November 2021, about 61.8% of\nthe adult population was \"in the labor force\"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking\nfor work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed. Table 21.1 shows those\nvalues. The unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the\npercentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:\nUnemployed people 5, 10\nUnemployment rate= e oo force\n\n508 21.Unemployment\nEmployed\nOut of labor force\n(99.977 thousand)\n(155,175 thousand)\nUnemployed\n(6,877 thousand)\nFIGURE 21.2 Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and\nolder), November 2021 The total adult, working-age population in November 2021 was 262.029 million. Out of this\ntotal population, 155.175 million were classified as employed, and 6.877 million were classified as unemployed.\nThe remaining 99.977 million were classified as out of the labor force.

The following\n‘Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.\nWORK IT T\nCalculating Labor Force Percentages\nHow do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will\nuse the values in Table 21.1 to illustrate the steps.\nTo determine the percentage in the labor force:\nStep 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (165.052 million) by the total adult (working-age)\npopulation (262.029 million).\nStep 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n21.1 « How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 509\n162.052\nPercentage out of the labor force=\n262.029\n=0.6184\n=61.8%\nTo determine the percentage out of the labor force:\nStep 1.

Multiply by 100 to obtain the rate.\nUnemployment rate= 6.877\n165.052\n=0.0416\n=42%\nHidden Unemployment\nEven with the “out of the labor force” category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the\ncategorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part\ntime or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as\nemployed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are\nindividuals who are underemployed. This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of\nwork but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would\nconsider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They\nare, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term\n“hidden unemployment.” Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,\nare no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nAnother important statistic is the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an\neconomy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in Figure 21.2\nand Table 21.1, those included in this calculation woulbde the 162.052 million individuals in the labor force.\n‘We calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the\nnumber unemployed, dividebyd the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For\nthe data from November 2021, the labor force participation rate is 61.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force\nparticipation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the\nworkforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation\nrate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly\nduring and after that recession. The labor force then climbed slowly during the 2010s but declined again\nduring the pandemic in March—April 2020 and remained lower than pre-pandemic levels as of early 2022.\n\n510 21.Unemployment\nThe Establishment Payroll Survey\n‘When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on\nthe number ofj obs created—which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based\non a survey of about 147,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates\npayroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and\naverage hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the\nself-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs\nand full time jobs with “decent” pay.\nHow Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S. Unemployment Data?\nThe unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the first Friday of each month for\nthe previous month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau has carried out every\nmonth since 1940. The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole.\nThe country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to\nsurvey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into\nclusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 oft he four-\nhousehold clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive\nmonths, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four\nmonths the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.\nBased on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of\neducation statistics comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide variety of other\ninformation is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become\nunemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed\nperson the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information\nabout employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS,\nread the following Clear it Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the difference between CPS and EPS?\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of\nthe labor force that is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll\nsurvey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\nCriticisms of Measuring Unemployment\nThere are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people\nwho do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouragebyd the lack of available jobs in their\narea and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, mabye suffering the pains of unemployment.\nHowever, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other\npeople may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that\neager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more\naccurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something\nlike yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities.\nThey may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.\nAlthough the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the\nBureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues\nand to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n21.2 « Patterns of Unemployment 511\neconomic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be\nquite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.\n®\n)%(\netaR\ntnemyolpmenU\n0 T T T T T T\n©® L9 WOoWOoWYQWgIyowo\nS B3ORRIBB333338228R\n> 2323200633509009\n@ 22222222K2RK3RK\n@\n‘\n4"

Phonology refers to the actual sound stem of language.\nChildren must learn to produce and recognize the sounds of language, separating them from\nenvironmental noises and speech sounds that do not denote differences in meaning. The\nability to distinguish between differences in sound that do not denote differences in meaning\nand those differences in sound that do denote differences in meaning is called categorical\nperception. There are about 40 phonemes, or speech sounds, in English.\nSemantics involves the learning of word meanings. For example, a child must learn that\ncertain combinations of phonemes represent certain physical objects or events, and that\ncertain words refer to entire categories, such as women, while others refer to specific members\nof categories, such as mommy.\n80\n\n|<\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nDevelopmental Psychology\nSyntax refers to how words are put together to form sentences. The child must notice the\neffects of word order on meaning.\nFinally, pragmatics consists of the actual efficient use of a language. Often the same sentence\nwill have two or more very different meanings depending on how it is spoken. A child must\nlearn to recognize these inflections and must learn to produce them as well.\nAn important precursor to language is babbling. Almost without exception, children—\nincluding deaf children—spontaneously begin to babble during their first year. In an\nimportant study, Lenneberg, Rebelsky, and Nichols (1965) showed that the age babbling\nbegins is about the same for hearing children with hearing parents, hearing children with\ndeaf parents, and deaf children. However, for hearing children, babbling continues and\nbecomes more frequent, reaching its highest frequency between 9 and 12 months. For deaf\nchildren, verbal babbling ceases soon after it begins. An interesting 1991 study by Petitto and\nMarentette, however, suggests that deaf children with parents using sign language appear to\nbabble using their hands!\nLanguage Acquisition\nBy around 18 months, the child may know dozens of words, but will usually utter them only\none at a time. Because of this limitation, a word can mean more than one thing. For instance,\ndepending on the child’s intonation and/or accompanying gestures, the child could be using\nthe word apple to label an apple, to ask for an apple, to ask whether a particular object is an\napple, and so on. A toddler’s use of a single word to express a complete thought is known as\nholophrasis. (The single word thus employed is called a holophrase.) Between 18 and 20\nmonths of age, a child will begin combining words.\nFundamentally, knowledge of a language is evidenced by the ability to produce novel,\ngrammatically correct sentences while refraining from producing nongrammatically correct\nones. It also implies the ability to distinguish between such sentences.\nAround the age of 2.5 to 3 years, children begin producing longer sentences. As development\ncontinues, vocabulary increases rapidly. You might expect that grammatical errors would\ndecrease in this time as well, but the opposite is true. As children begin to master complex\ngeneral rules, we often see what is referred to as errors of growth, or overregulation. A child\nwho once said, “I ran” will now say “I runned to the store.” Many of these errors are universal\nand are not the result of environmental influence. For instance, almost all boys at this age use\n“hisself” instead of “himself? even though children probably never hear the word “hisself”\nused by an adult. It is thought that children are generalizing some internalized rule. This\nsuggests that language acquisition may not be the result of imitation and reinforcement, but\nthe active application of a dynamic internalized set of linguistic rules.\nFor the most part, language is substantially mastered by the age of 5. This would suggest that\nlanguage acquisition is fairly simple. Yet many adults find learning a second language to be a\ndifficult task. Indeed, the ease with which children learn their first language has led some\npsychologists to speculate that children must have some special innate capacity for language\nacquisition. The name most closely associated with this position is that of linguist Noam Chomsky.\n81\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 4\nChomsky is known for his study of transformational grammar. He focused on syntactic\ntransformations, or changes in word order that differ with meaning. Chomsky noted that\nchildren learn to make such transformations effortlessly at an early age. He therefore\nconcluded that this ability must be innate. This innate capacity for language acquisition is\nsometimes called a language acquisition device (LAD), and is thought to be triggered by\nexposure to language. The LAD enables infants to listen to and process sounds.\nNativists such as Chomsky believe in a critical period between age 2 years and puberty for\nlanguage acquisition. They believe that if a child was not exposed to language during this\ncritical time, then being exposed to language later would be ineffective. It would have been\nunethical to design and conduct an experiment to test the theory. Unfortunately, a test case\ncame to light with a victim of severe child abuse named Genie.\nGenie was almost completely isolated from human contact from age 2 to 13, when she was\ndiscovered by authorities. Although she had been exposed to no language during this time,\nafter training she was able to learn some aspects of syntax. Still, she was unable to master\nother aspects of syntax. What this may show us is that instead of a critical period in language\ndevelopment, there may be a sensitive period in language development. A sensitive period is\nthe time when environmental input has maximal effect on the development of a particular\nability. Most psychologists consider the sensitive period for language development to be\nbefore the onset of puberty.\n82"

      "reference_material_content": "I<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 6\nCENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS\nNerve Cells\nGenerally speaking, there are three kinds of nerve cells in the nervous system: sensory\nneurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons (also known as afferent\nneurons) transmit sensory information from receptors to the spinal cord and brain. Motor\nneurons (also known as efferent neurons) transmit motor information from the brain and\nspinal cord to the muscles. Interneurons are found between other neurons and are the most\nnumerous of the three types of neurons. Interneurons are.located predominantly in the brain\n140\n\n| IK\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nPhysiological Psychology\nand spinal cord and are linked to reflexive behavior. This type of behavior is controlled by\nneural circuits called reflex arcs. Behavior that is crucial to survival is controlled by reflexes.\nWhen receptors in the foot detect pain (e.g., when you step on a nail), the pain signal is\ntransmitted by sensory neurons up to the spinal cord. At that point, the sensory neurons\nconnect with interneurons, which then relay pain impulses up to the brain. Because\ninterneurons in the spinal cord are closer to your foot, it would be faster if they could tell\nyour foot to move instead of waiting for the brain to do it. In fact, this is exactly what happens\nin the reflex arc. Sensory neurons first send out impulses signaling the presence of pain. As\nsoon as the impulses arrive at the spinal cord, interneurons immediately transmit that\ninformation to the motor neurons. Without wasting any time, the motor neurons tell your\nfoot to step away from the nail. Bear in mind that the original sensory information still makes\nits way up to the brain. But by the time it arrives there, the muscles have already responded\nto the pain, thanks to the reflex arc.\nAs mentioned earlier, functionalists such as John Dewey criticized the breaking down of\nreflex processes into separate stimuli and responses. Functionalists preferred to study the\nprocess as a whole. To break down the reflex arc into different motor and sensory phases, was,\nfor Dewey, a useless artificial separation.\nHuman Nervous System\nLet’s turn now to the overall structure of the human nervous system, which is diagrammed\nin Figure 1. The nervous system can be broadly divided into two primary components: the\ncentral and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS), is composed of\nthe brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS), in contrast, is made up of\nnerve tissue and fibers outside the brain and spinal cord (i.e., the PNS connects the CNS to\nthe rest of the body). The peripheral nervous system is subdivided into somatic and\nautonomic nervous systems.\nNervous System .\nCentral Nervous System Peripheral Nervous System\nBrain . Spinal. Cord Somatic Autonomic\nP Nervous Nervous\nSystem System\nParasympathetic Sympathetic\nNervous Nervous\nSystem System\nFigure 1. Major Subdivisions of the Nervous System\n141\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 6\nThe somatic nervous system consists of sensory and motor neurons distributed throughout\nthe skin and muscles. Sensory neurons transmit information through afferent fibers. Motor\nimpulses, in contrast, travel along efferent fibers. Since it’s easy to confuse these two, try to\nremember them like this: sensory impulses travel along afferent fibers, which ascend up to\nthe brain; motor impulses travel along efferent fibers, which exit the brain and spinal cord on\ntheir way down to the muscles. The GRE Psychology Test tends not to ask much about the\nsomatic nervous system.\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) appears often on the GRE Psychology Test, so it’s worth\nknowing in some detail. Pioneering work in regard to the ANS was done by Walter Cannon.\nThe ANS generally regulates heartbeat, respiration, digestion, and glandular secretions. In\nother words, the ANS manages the involuntary functions associated with many internal\norgans and glands. The ANS also helps regulate body temperature by activating sweating or\nshivering, depending on whether we are too hot or too cold. The main thing to understand\nabout these functions is that they are automatic, or independent of conscious control. Note\nthe similarity between the words autonomic and automatic. This association makes it easy to\nremember that the autonomic nervous system manages automatic functions such as\nheartbeat, respiration, digestion, and temperature control.\nThe ANS has two subdivisions: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic\nnervous system. These two branches often act in opposition to one another, meaning that\nthey are antagonistic. An illustration of this is that the sympathetic nervous system acts to\naccelerate heartbeat and inhibit digestion. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system,\nin contrast, decelerates heartbeat and increases digestion.\nThe main role of the parasympathetic nervous system is to conserve energy. It is associated\nwith resting and sleeping states, and acts to reduce heart and respiration rates. The\nparasympathetic nervous system is also responsible for managing digestion. The\nparasympathetic nervous system thus promotes “resting and digesting”—a phrase that\ncaptures what you need to know for the test. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter\nresponsible for parasympathetic responses in the body.\nIn contrast, the sympathetic nervous system is activated whenever you face stressful\nsituations. This can include everything from a mild stressor, such as keeping up with your\nschoolwork, to emergencies that mean the difference between life and death. The sympathetic\nnervous system is closely associated with fear and rage reactions, also known as “fight or\nflight” reactions. Because the sympathetic nervous system often appears on the test, it’s a\ngood idea to know some specific physiological responses associated with “fight or flight”\nreactions. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the body mobilizes for fighting\nfor one’s life, or for running for one’s life. Therefore, there are increases in heart rate, blood-\nsugar level, and respiration. In contrast to the parasympathetic activation, “fight or flight”\nreactions act to decrease digestive processes. The sympathetic nervous system also causes\nthe pupils in the eyes to dilate (open wider) in order to increase the amount of visual\ninformation reaching the retina. Also, the neurotransmitter adrenaline is released into the\n142\n\n| IK\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nPhysiological Psychology\nbloodstream during fear and rage reactions. An “adrenaline rush” gives you more energy than\nusual in order to contend with emergencies; it helps you run faster or fight harder at times\nwhen you need everything you've got. Overall, most of the physiological responses associated\nwith the sympathetic nervous system act in ways to maximize energy for quick responses to\nthreatening situations.\nparietal lobe\nfrontal lobe\ncorpus callosum fs) thalamus\noccipital lobe\n=e Ca- ae\nsuperior and\nmidbrain\npituitary gland & £5 BF\nnies fe ;\noy cerebellum\npons varolii\nmedulla\nspinal cord\nFigure 2.

      "reference_material_content": "DEFINED: Personality is the study of why people act the way that they do and why different\npeople act differently. Personality theory is necessarily bound up in clinical theory, so a great deal\nof information about personality can be found in the Clinical Psychology chapter. For example,\nFreud's theory asserted that personality is what emerges from the struggle between the ego, id, and\nsuperego. (FormoreonFreud, turntotheClinical and Developmental Psychology chapters.) Infact,\nall of the clinical theorists mentioned in the Clinical Psychology chapter necessarily have their own\nslantonpersonality. Youshouldknowthese. Buttoavoidredundancy,thoseclinicaltheoristsarenot\ncovered in this chapter.\nOLD SCHOOL: TYPE THEORY\nType theory originally dominated personality theory. As far back as Hippocrates, people were\nplacedintopersonality-typecategoriesoftenbasedonphysicalappearance. Inthe 1800s, phrenology\n(the practice of examining head and skull shape) was used to discern personality.\nLater, William Sheldon devised a system based on somatotypes (body types). Although the\ntheory has no modern credence, itis an importantpartoftheevolution ofthe field. Sheldon isolated\nthree physiques and the corresponding personality types:\n—\n• Endomorph short, plump body = pleasure-seeking, social behavior.\n—\n• Mesomorph muscular, athletic body = energetic, aggressive behavior.\n—\n• Ectomorph skinny, fragile body = inhibited, intellectual behavior.\nMorerecentlythanSheldon,Alfred Adlersuggestedapersonalitytypology (seeClinicalPsychol-\nogy chapter). For the most part, however, type theories have given way to trait theories.\nNEW SCHOOL: TRAIT THEORY\nGordon Allportemphasizedan ideographicapproachtopersonalitytheory.Thisapproachattempts\ntocaptureanindividual'sunique,definingcharacteristics,opposedtoanomotheticapproach,which\nuses largenumbers ofpeople tostudy thecommonalitiesofpersonality. Allportwasconcerned only\nwithconsciousmotivesgovernedbythepropriumorpropriatefunction(hisversionoftheego),and\nhebelieved thatthepropriumacted somewhatconsistentlybasedontraits it had developed through\nexperience.\nAllportandhisstudentsworkedtoidentifyallofthepossibletraitsthatcouldgowithpersonality.\nTraits are the relativelystablecharacteristics ofbehaviorthatapersonexhibits, such asintroversion,\npoliteness, and stinginess. Using a lexical approach (meaningpicking all ofthe possible traits outof\nthe dictionary), Allport gathered about 5,000 possible traits. Next, Allport hypothesized thatpeople\nact differently in different situations because they have a trait hierarchy: at the top a cardinal trait,\nthen central traits, then secondary traits. So while circumstances may cause a person to show\nconflicting secondary traits, he will always be consistent with his cardinal trait. (In trait theory, be\nsure to understand the differencebetween traits and states. Traits are relatively enduringcharacter-\nistics. States are temporary feelings or characteristics. A trait might be \"outgoing,\" whereas a state\nmight be \"tired\").\n120 CRACKING THE GRE PSYCHOLOGY SUBJECT TEST\n\nLater, statistical techniques were used to create taxonomies (organized categorization systems)\nfor personality. Most importantly, Raymond Cattell used factor analysis in data reduction of\nAllport's 5,000 traits. Eventually, he identified sixteen bipolar source traits, such as relaxed-tense,\nthat seemed to underlie all of the 5,000 (often overlapping) traits. These were Cattell's sixteen\npersonality factors tested in his sixteen personality questionnaire. Amazingly, Cattell accomplished\nthis massive factor analysis before the computer age.\nLater, using advanced computer statistical programs, modern theorists could not replicate\nCattell's findings, but they did generate findings of their own. The hot topic in personality trait\ntheory today is the \"Big Five.\" The Big Five are superfactors, or five dimensions that seem to\nencompass all of personality. They are superordinate traits or facets. Know these Big Five dimen-\nsions:\n1. O-dimension (openness to experience, intellectual curiosity)\n2. C-dimension (conscientiousness)\n3. E-dimension (extroversion, enthusiasm)\n4. A-dimension (agreeableness)\n5. N-dimension (neuroticism, nervousness)\nWHERE DOES PERSONALITY COME FROM?\nOriginally personality theory was dominated by dispositionists (people who emphasized internal\ndeterminants of behavior). Of course, situationists (such as behaviorists) have argued that only\ncircumstances determine behavior. Currently, interactionists are in the forefront; they assert a\ncombination of stable, internal factors and situations.\nEvidence for both disposition and situation exits. Critics such as Seymour Epstein and Walter\nMischel have asserted that trait and type theories have always had a big problem: Both theories\nassume that a person'sbehavior is stable across situations and that people fail to take circumstances\ninto account. Studies (and real life) show that people often act differently in different situations. The\n—\npossibility a personmaybehave inconsistently that a respected minister maybe a closet adulterer,\n—\nfor example is called the consistency paradox and presents real problems for labeling people as\nhaving one internal disposition.\nOnewayofshowingthatpersonalitytraitsexistwithinapersonwouldbetoshow thattheperson\nexhibits those traits in a variety of different situations. Mischel, with Nancy Cantor, proposed the\ncognitive prototype approach, inwhichcognitivebehavior (suchas theformulation ofand attention\nto prototypes), is examined in social situations. In short, Mischel thought that consistency of\nbehavior is the result of cognitive processes, rather than the result of personality traits per se.\nTwin studies have indicated that the heritability of personality is about 40-50 percent. After\nlocating identical twins separated at birth, psychologists have found remarkable similarities in\npersonality and behavior. Most notably, the \"Jim\" twins had wives with the same name, dogs with\nthe same name, and the same habits. But, ofcourse, they were not exactly the same, and this shows\nthat environment has some impact on personality.\nPERSONALITY 121\n\nGENDER DIFFERENCES\nThe nature-nurture debate is most alive in the area of gender differences. Some assert that no true\n—\ngender differences exist children are simply reinforced for stereotypical behaviors. It is true that\nafter taking into account differential social reinforcement, very few gender differences remain. Still,\nthe prevailing point ofview is interactionist.\n• Kay Deaux found that women's successes at stereotypical \"male\" tasks\nare often attributed to luck, while men's successes are often attributed to\nskill. This suggests that gender is a social construct that colors interpreta-\ntions. Also, studies have found that women themselves attribute their\nsuccesses to luck more than men, indicating that women have lower self-\nesteem than men.\n• Sandra Bern studied androgyny (possessingboth male and female quali-\nties) and created the Bern Sex Role Inventory. Androgenous individuals\nhave been found to have higher self-esteem, lower anxiety, and more\nadaptability than their highly masculine or feminine counterparts.\n• Matina Horner suggested that females shunned masculine-type successes\nnotbecause of fear of failure or lack ofinterest. Rather, women feared\nsuccess and its negative repercussions, such as resentment and rejection.\n• Alice Eagly found an interactionbetween gender and social status with\nregard to how easily an individual mightbe influenced or swayed.\n• Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin scrutinized studies ofsex differences\nand found that relatively few existed that could notbe explained awayby\nsimple social learning. The most consistent difference that seems indepen-\ndent of social influence is that females have greaterverbal ability and\nmales have greater visual/spatial ability. This has been attributed to\ninternal biological or hormonal differences but is still hotly debated.\n• Women are twice as likely as men to become depressed.\nOTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\n• Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman studied Type A personality. Type A\npersonality is characterized by drive, competitiveness, aggressiveness, and\ntension and is most commonly found in middle-to-upper-class men. Grant\nDahlstrom linked Type A personality to heart disease and other health\nproblems. The connection between personality and health is currently a\npopular vein of study.\n• Hans Eysenck used factor analysis to identify the traits underneath the\ntwo personality-type dimensions of introversion-extraversion and stable-\nunstable (neuroticism). These two dimensions formed a cross and, there-\nfore, four quadrants: phlegmatic, melancholic, choleric, and sanguine.\n122 CRACKING THE GRE PSYCHOLOGY SUBJECT TEST"

      "reference_material_content": "I<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 3\nPROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR\nSocial psychologists are interested in understanding the determinants of prosocial behavior,\nor behaviors that benefit other individuals or groups of people, called helping behavior and\naltruism. Altruism is a form of helping behavior in which the person’s intent is to benefit\nsomeone else at some cost to himself or herself. Helping behavior includes altruistic\nmotivations, but also includes behaviors that may be motivated by egoism or selfishness.\nBystander Intervention\nThe most celebrated line of research in the area of helping behavior is the work of John\nDarley and Bibb Latané on bystander intervention. Darley and Latané’s research can be\ntraced to a single event. In March of 1964 in Kew Gardens, New York, a woman named Kitty\nGenovese was stabbed to death in three separate attacks by the same man. Because she\nresisted, the killing took more than a half-hour. Thirty-eight people were identified as having\n40\n\nmis\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nSocial Psychology\nwitnessed the attack and having heard her scream for help. Twice, their apartment lights\nthreatened away the would-be killer. Twice, he returned. None of the witnesses intervened, or\neven called the police. After the killing there was talk of the dehumanization of people and\nwhat was initially termed “bystanders’ apathy.” Mention was made of a new kind of creature,\nHomo urbanus, a city dweller whose only interest is in himself. The apathy of the bystanders\nwas blamed on their personality flaws.\nSeveral days after the killing, Darley and Latané developed a very different interpretation. The\nbystanders, they thought, were not monsters. They were not even apathetic. Rather, they were\nengaged in the normal problem-solving process—trying to figure out what was going on and\nwhat to do about it. Unfortunately, their problem-solving process, which included evaluation\nof deterrents, led to not helping. However, it was interpreted that anyone in any emergency\nmight decide not to help, largely because of two situational factors, social influerice and\ndiffusion of responsibility (and diffusion of responsibility was the most significant factor at\nKew Gardens that night).\nLatané and Darley decided to test for social influence factors by staging emergencies in\nlaboratory settings, since many emergencies are ambiguous (smoke does not necessarily\nmean fire). Bystanders must first define the situation—a person’s judgment will be influenced\nby past experiences, desires, what the person actually sees, and the influence of other people\npresent (social influence). Indeed, the presence of others may lead to the interpretation of an\nevent as a nonemergency.\nLatané and Darley tested for the social influence process in bystander intervention by studying\nthe behavior of students who witnessed an ambiguous event. The students thought that they\nwere taking part in an interview on urban environments. While they were completing a\nquestionnaire, an acrid white smoke was piped into the room. The situation was ambiguous.\nThe smoke could have come from a fire, or it could have been steam from a radiator. Subjects\nexperienced one of two conditions: the subject was either alone or with two confederates. The\nconfederates were trained to notice the smoke, ensure that the subject saw them notice, and\nthen return to the questionnaire. Latané and Darley hypothesized that the two nonresponsive\nconfederates would inhibit the response of the subject. They would influence the subject to\ndefine the smoke as a nonemergency. This hypothesis was confirmed. In post-experimental\ninterviews, those who did not respond said that they thought it was not a fire. This concept is\nknown as pluralistic ignorance: leading others to a definition of an event as a nonemergency.\nThe second process Latané and Darley studied was diffusion of responsibility. Once an\nindividual interprets that a situation constitutes an emergency, the person has to decide\nwhether or not to help. If there is only one bystander at an emergency, the bystander knows\nthat the responsibility for assisting falls on his or her shoulders. That individual has one\nhundred percent of the responsibility to help, will receive one hundred percent of the blame,\nand will feel one hundred percent of the guilt for not helping. If others are present, however,\nthen the responsibility, blame, and guilt can be shared. As the person weighs the costs and\nrewards of helping and attempts to resolve the conflict between helping and not helping, the\nfact that others are in a position to help may sway the person toward not helping.\n41\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 3\nLatané and Darley conducted another classic experiment to test for the diffusion of\nresponsibility factor in an experiment that would not be affected by the social influence\nprocess. The researchers led the subjects in the experiment to believe that they were\nparticipating in a discussion on college life. A subject was placed alone in a booth and told\nthat the discussion would take place by intercom. Each person was allowed two minutes to\nspeak. During those two minutes, only the microphone of the person speaking would be\nturned on. So it was not a discussion in the interactive sense. The test subject was not aware\nthat he or she was the only live participant and that no one was actually listening to him\nspeak. The other speeches were prerecorded. The subjects believed that there were one, two,\nor five other participants. One of the prerecorded participants spoke about a tendency\ntoward epileptic seizures. Later he pretended to have a seizure (prerecorded, of course). The\nemergency, then, was not ambiguous and the subject could not tell how other “bystanders”\nwere reacting.\nSince subjects were not aware of anyone else’s reaction in this experiment, the social influence\nprocess was not a factor. Darley and Latané found that when subjects thought that they were\nthe only ones listening, one hundred percent reported the seizure. When subjects thought\nthat two others were listening, 85 percent reported the seizure. When subjects thought that\nfour others were listening, the seizure was reported only 62 percent of the time. The results\nsupported the diffusion of responsibility hypothesis. The more people present, the less the\nlikelihood that any individual will offer help.\nEmpathy and Helping Behavior\nEmpathy is the ability to vicariously experience the emotions of another, and it is thought by\nsome social psychologists to be a strong influence on helping behavior. Batson’s empathy-\naltruism model is one explanation for the relationship between empathy and helping\nbehavior. According to this model, when faced with situations in which others may need help,\npeople might feel distress (mental pain or anguish), and/or they might feel empathy.\nAccording to the model, both of these states are important, since either can determine\nhelping behavior. (Some social psychologists disagree fundamentally, and, instead, believe\nthat helping behavior occurs only when there is some benefit to the individual offering help.)\nBatson’s model was tested in a series of experiments in which subjects witnessing a person in\ndistress are given a choice to either help or not help that person. (In this context, distress can\nalso include physical pain.) In a typical experiment, subjects watched a closed-circuit\ntelevision displaying a person needing help (e.g., appearing to receive painful electric shocks).\nSome of the subjects were given a choice to leave after the first two electric shocks (the easy-\nescape condition), and others were asked to stay to witness ten electric shocks (the difficult-\nescape condition). After the second shock, all of the subjects completed a questionnaire that\nmeasured the degree to which they felt distress and empathy for the person experiencing the\nshocks. The subjects were then told that the person being shocked also experienced traumatic\nshocks as a child, and they were given the opportunity to take that person’s place to receive\nthe remaining eight shocks. Subjects in the easy-escape condition who reported more distress\n42\n\n| IK\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nSocial Psychology\nthan empathy, tended to leave rather than help. Subjects who reported more empathy than\ndistress were more likely to help regardless of whether they were in the easy- or the difficult-\nescape conditions.\nAGGRESSIVE AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR\nFrustration-Aggression Hypothesis\nThe frustration-aggression hypothesis is one possible explanation social psychologists have\nfound for aggressive behavior. According to this perspective, when people are frustrated, they\nact aggressively. In fact, researchers have found that the strength of the frustration experienced\nis correlated with the level of aggression observed.\nBandura’s Social Learning Theory\nBandura’s social learning theory is perhaps the most influential theory on aggression that is\nalso focused on social context. Bandura’s theory holds that aggression is learned through\nmodeling (direct observation), or through reinforcement (covered in detail in the chapter\non learning and ethology). In his famous study on the effect of modeling, Bandura had two\ngroups of young children aged 3—5 observe either an adult playing with tinker toys or an\nadult committing aggressive acts on an inflated rubber “Bobo” doll. In the next phase of the\n- experiment, each child was made to feel frustrated and then left alone in a room full of toys,\nincluding the rubber doll. Children who had observed the aggressive model were more likely\nto behave aggressively toward the doll, similarly to the adult, than the children who had not\nobserved the aggressive model. In some cases, the children copied the aggression on the\nrubber doll blow for blow. Bandura also believed that aggressive behavior is selectively\nreinforced—that people act aggressively because they expect some sort of reward (material\nbenefit, social approval, attention) for doing so.\n43"

This theory holds that there are several\ndifferent memory systems and that each system has a different function. Furthermore, the\ntheory suggests that memories enter the various systems in a specific order. These three\nmemory systems are called sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory\n(incidentally, many psychologists today prefer to use the phrase working memory instead of\nshort-term memory).\n257\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 9\nSensory Memory\nSensory memory contains fleeting impressions of sensory stimuli. Visual memory is\nsometimes called iconic memory, and auditory memory is sometimes called echoic memory.\nInformation does not last long in this memory; at most, for a few seconds.\nTo find out how much information could be retained in sensory memory, early researchers_\nused a method called the whole-report procedure. In this method, subjects looked for a\nfraction of a second at a visual display of nine items such as the one shown in Figure 2. They\nwere then asked to recall as many of the items as they could. On average, subjects could\nremember only about four of the nine items. Researchers interpreted this as evidence that the\ncapacity of sensory memory was only four items. However, a young researcher by the name\nof George Sperling suspected that this might not be an accurate indication of the capacity of\nsensory Memory.\naee ea .\nepM|ere aes\nFigure 2. A Sample 3-by-3 Array Used to Study Sensory Memory\nSperling devised a method called the partial-report procedure. Like the earlier researchers,\nhe used a 3 X 3 matrix of letters and flashed the array for a fraction of a second. However,\nunlike earlier researchers, he asked the subjects to report only one row of the array.\nImmediately after the presentation of the array of letters, a high, medium, or low tone was\npresented, indicating to the subjects which row to recall. Notice that the subjects didn’t know\nbeforehand what row they had to recall. Therefore, the subjects couldn’t focus on just one\nrow. It turned out that, regardless of which row Sperling asked for, the subjects’ recall was\nnearly perfect, thus suggesting that the capacity of sensory memory was about nine items.\nOther experiments with larger arrays confirmed the nine-item limit. So, in the whole report\nmethod, as the subjects were reporting what they saw, their sensory memory of the array was\ndecaying. By the time the subjects reported about four of the stimuli, the memory had\nalready decayed. Sterling’s procedure, however, avoided this problem.\nShort-Term Memory\nIn real life, we are bombarded with sensations at any given moment. What happens to all of\nthis input? Well, most of the information just leaves your sensory memory within a few\nseconds. However, information that you attend to goes from your sensory memory into your\nshort-term memory. Short-term memory can be thought of as the link between our rapidly\nchanging sensory memory and the more lasting long-term memory.\n258\n\nmis\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nCognitive Psychology\nHow long information remains in short-term memory depends on what is done with it. If\nnothing is done with the information, it will remain in short-term memory for only about\n20 seconds. However, if the information is rehearsed, it can stay in short-term memory for a\nrelatively long time, as long as you keep rehearsing the information (as when you repeat a\nphone number you want to remember). This is called maintenance rehearsal.\nThere is a limit to the amount of information that can be kept in short-term memory. George\nMiller found that seven (plus or minus two) pieces, or chunks, of information can be stored\nin short-term memory. Chunks are meaningful units of information. To get a sense for how\nchunking information into seven or fewer units of information can be an effective method\nfor using your short-term memory, imagine trying to remember the following list of\nnumbers: 1976181416431475 1203. You could probably remember about seven of\nthese numbers. If, however, you chunk the numbers, you could probably remember all of\nthem: 1976, 1814, 1643, 1475 and 1203. Breaking the numbers down into five years will make\nit much easier to remember all of the numbers.\nLong-Term Memory\nThe phenomenon of chunking is an important interaction in behavior and long-term\nmemory. Long-term memory can be considered to be the permanent storehouse of your\nexperiences, knowledge, and skills. Items in long-term memory can be brief or can last a\nlifetime. One of the ways we get information into long-term memory is by using elaborative\nrehearsal, which involves organizing the material and associating it with information you\nalready have in long-term memory.\nTYPES OF REHEARSAL\nType Definition Use\nMaintenance Repeating the information Keeping the\ninformation in\nshort-term\nmemory\nElaborative Organizing the information and Getting the\nassociating it with information information\nalready in long-term memory into long-term\nmemory\n259\n\nI<|\nSection Three: Psychology Review\nChapter 9\nThere are two types of long-term memory: procedural memory and declarative memory.\nProcedural memory has to do with remembering how things are done. It includes things like\nhow to tie your shoelaces, how to swim, how to ride a bike, etc. Declarative memory is where\nexplicit information is stored. Sometimes it is called fact memory. There are two types of\ndeclarative memory: semantic memory and episodic memory. Semantic memory has to do\nwith remembering general knowledge, especially the meanings of words and concepts.\nEpisodic memory refers to memories for particular events, or episodes, that you have»\npersonally experienced.\nLONG-TERM MEMORY\nType Concerned With\nProcedural memory Remembering how to do things\nDeclarative memory Remembering explicit information\nSemantic memory Remembering general knowledge\nEpisodic memory Remembering particular events you have\npersonally experienced\nEncoding\nIn general, encoding for verbal material in short-term memory differs from that of long-term\nmemory. Encoding for verbal material in short-term memory tends to be phonological or\nacoustic, rather than visual. For example, when asked to recall letters from short-term\nmemory, confusions tend to occur with letters that sound alike, e.g., D and T, rather than\nwith letters that look alike, e.g., D and O. On the other hand, items in long-term memory are\nmore likely to be encoded on the basis of their meaning. This assertion is supported by\nstudies of semantic priming. In the usual semantic priming task, the subject has to decide\nwhether a stimulus is a word or a nonword. In one classic experiment, subjects were presented\nwith pairs of words, some of which were semantically related (e.g., NURSE-DOCTOR) and\nsome of which were not (e.g., NURSE-BUTTER). The subjects’ task was to press a Yes button\nif both words were real words and to press a No button if both words were not real words.\nThe response time was quicker if the two words were semantically related.\nENCODING: SHORT-TERM MEMORY VERSUS LONG-TERM MEMORY\nMemory System Encoding of Verbai Material Likely to Be Based On\nShort-term memory Phonology\nLong-term memory Meaning\n260"

But successes and failures on social media can tie people together. Challenges can lead to\nchats, recollections, and repeats.\nHumans seek connections and shared experiences. Perhaps experiencing a flash mob event enhances this bond. It\ncertainly interrupts our otherwise mundane routine with a reminder that we are social animals.\nForms of Collective Behavior\nFlash mobs are examples ofcollective behavior, noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people\nvoluntarily engage. Other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of\nteens adopting a favorite singer’s hairstyle. In short, collective behavior is any group behavior that is not\n\n628 21 • Social Movements and Social Change\nmandated or regulated by an institution. There are three primary forms of collective behavior: the crowd, the\nmass, and the public.\nIt takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form acrowd(Lofland 1993). Examples include a\ngroup of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert, tailgating at a Patriots game, or attending a worship\nservice. Turner and Killian (1993) identified four types of crowds.Casual crowdsconsist of people who are in\nthe same place at the same time but who aren’t really interacting, such as people standing in line at the post\noffice.Conventional crowdsare those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly, like a\nreligious service.Expressive crowdsare people who join together to express emotion, often at funerals,\nweddings, or the like. The final type,acting crowds,focuses on a specific goal or action, such as a protest\nmovement or riot.\nIn addition to the different types of crowds, collective groups can also be identified in two other ways. Amassis\na relatively large number of people with a common interest, though they may not be in close proximity\n(Lofland 1993), such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville. Apublic, on the other hand, is an\nunorganized, relatively diffused group of people who share ideas, such as the Libertarian political party. While\nthese two types of crowds are similar, they are not the same. To distinguish between them, remember that\nmembers of a mass share interests, whereas members of a public share ideas.\nTheoretical Perspectives on Collective Behavior\nEarly collective behavior theories (LeBon 1895; Blumer 1969) focused on the irrationality of crowds.\nEventually, those theorists who viewed crowds as uncontrolled groups of irrational people were supplanted by\ntheorists who viewed the behavior some crowds engaged in as the rational behavior of logical beings.\nEmergent-Norm Perspective\nFIGURE21.3According to the emergent-norm perspective, Hurricane Katrina victims sought needed supplies for\nsurvival, but to some outsiders their behavior was normally seen as looting. (Credit: Infrogmation/Wikimedia\nCommons)\nSociologists Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1993) built on earlier sociological ideas and developed what is\nknown as emergent norm theory. They believe that the norms experienced by people in a crowd may be\ndisparate and fluctuating. They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior,\nespecially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors.Emergent norm theory\nasserts that, in this circumstance, people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular\n(individual) set of norms, which may change as the crowd experience evolves. This focus on the individual\ncomponent of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective.\nFor Turner and Killian, the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation, or\nwhen an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar. For example, think about human behavior\nduring Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans was decimated and people were trapped without supplies or a way to\nevacuate. In these extraordinary circumstances, what outsiders saw as “looting” was defined by those involved\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n21.1 • Collective Behavior 629\nas seeking needed supplies for survival. Normally, individuals would not wade into a corner gas station and\ntake canned goods without paying, but given that they were suddenly in a greatly changed situation, they\nestablished a norm that they felt was reasonable.\nOnce individuals find themselves in a situation ungoverned by previously established norms, they interact in\nsmall groups to develop new guidelines on how to behave. According to the emergent-norm perspective,\ncrowds are not viewed as irrational, impulsive, uncontrolled groups. Instead, norms develop and are accepted\nas they fit the situation. While this theory offers insight into why norms develop, it leaves undefined the nature\nof norms, how they come to be accepted by the crowd, and how they spread through the crowd.\nValue-Added Theory\nNeil Smelser’s (1962) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior, calledvalue-added theory,is a perspective\nwithin the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective\nbehavior to occur. Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur. The first condition\nisstructural conduciveness,which occurs when people are aware of the problem and have the opportunity to\ngather, ideally in an open area.Structural strain, the second condition, refers to people’s expectations about\nthe situation at hand being unmet, causing tension and strain. The next condition is thegrowth and spread of a\ngeneralized belief, wherein a problem is clearly identified and attributed to a person or group.\nFourth,precipitating factorsspur collective behavior; this is the emergence of a dramatic event. The fifth\ncondition ismobilization for action, when leaders emerge to direct a crowd to action. The final condition\nrelates to action by the agents. Calledsocial control, it is the only way to end the collective behavior episode\n(Smelser 1962).\nA real-life example of these conditions occurred after the fatal police shooting of teenager Michael Brown, an\nunarmed eighteen-year-old African American, in Ferguson, MO on August 9, 2014. The shooting drew national\nattention almost immediately. A large group of mostly Black, local residents assembled in protest—a classic\nexample of structural conduciveness. When the community perceived that the police were not acting in the\npeople's interest and were withholding the name of the officer, structural strain became evident. A growing\ngeneralized belief evolved as the crowd of protesters were met with heavily armed police in military-style\nprotective uniforms accompanied by an armored vehicle. The precipitating factor of the arrival of the police\nspurred greater collective behavior as the residents mobilized by assembling a parade down the street.\nUltimately they were met with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets used by the police acting as agents of\nsocial control. The element of social control escalated over the following days until August 18, when the\ngovernor called in the National Guard.\n\n630 21 • Social Movements and Social Change\nFIGURE21.4Agents of social control bring collective behavior to an end. (Credit: hozinja/flickr)\nAssembling Perspective\nInteractionist sociologist Clark McPhail (1991) developedassembling perspective,another system for\nunderstanding collective behavior that credited individuals in crowds as rational beings. Unlike previous\ntheories, this theory refocuses attention from collective behavior to collective action. Remember that collective\nbehavior is a noninstitutionalized gathering, whereas collective action is based on a shared interest. McPhail’s\ntheory focused primarily on the processes associated with crowd behavior, plus the lifecycle of gatherings. He\nidentified several instances of convergent or collective behavior, as shown on the chart below.\nType of crowd Description Example\nConvergence Carpooling parents take several children\nFamily and friends who travel together\nclusters to the movies\nConvergent\nGroup all facing the same direction A semi-circle around a stage\norientation\nCollective\nSounds or noises made collectively Screams on a roller coaster\nvocalization\nCollective Collective and simultaneous participation in a Pledge of Allegiance in the school\nverbalization speech or song classroom\nCollective\nBody parts forming symbols The YMCA dance\ngesticulation\nCollective\nObjects collectively moved around Holding signs at a protest rally\nmanipulation\nTABLE21.1Clark McPhail identified various circumstances of convergent and collective behavior (McPhail 1991).\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n21.2 • Social Movements 631\nType of crowd Description Example\nCollective The direction and rate of movement to the\nChildren running to an ice cream truck\nlocomotion event\nTABLE21.1Clark McPhail identified various circumstances of convergent and collective behavior (McPhail 1991).\nAs useful as this is for understanding the components of how crowds come together, many sociologists criticize\nits lack of attention on the large cultural context of the described behaviors, instead focusing on individual\nactions."

Indeed, all formal organizations are, or likely will become,\nbureaucracies. We will discuss the purpose of formal organizations and the structure of their bureaucracies.\nTypes of Formal Organizations\nFIGURE6.8Girl Scout troops and correctional facilities are both formal organizations. (Credit: (a) moonlightbulb/\nflickr; (b) CxOxS/flickr)\nSociologist Amitai Etzioni (1975) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories.Normative\norganizations, also calledvoluntary organizations, are based on shared interests. As the name suggests,\njoining them is voluntary. People find membership rewarding in an intangible way. They receive non-material\nbenefits. The Audubon Society and a ski club are examples of normative organizations.\nCoercive organizationsare groups that we must be coerced, or pushed, to join. These may include prison or a\nrehabilitation center. Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations aretotal\ninstitutions(1961). A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and\n\n160 6 • Groups and Organization\nin which total resocialization takes place.\nThe third type isutilitarian organizations, which, as the name suggests, are joined because of the need for a\nspecific material reward. High school and the workplace fall into this category—one joined in pursuit of a\ndiploma, the other in order to make money.\nNormative or Voluntary Coercive Utilitarian\nBenefit of Membership Intangible benefit Corrective benefit Tangible benefit\nType of Membership Volunteer basis Required Contractual basis\nFeeling of Connectedness Shared affinity No affinity Some affinity\nTABLE6.1Table of Formal OrganizationsThis table shows Etzioni’s three types of formal\norganizations. (Credit: Etzioni 1975)\nThe Structure of Bureaucracies\nBureaucracies are an ideal type of formal organization. By ideal, sociologists don’t mean “best.” Rather,\nbureaucracies have a collection of characteristics that most of them exhibit. Pioneer sociologist Max Weber\ncharacterized a bureaucracy as having a hierarchy of authority, a clear division of labor, explicit rules, and\nimpersonality (1922). People often complain about bureaucracies––declaring them slow, rule-bound, difficult\nto navigate, and unfriendly. Let’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean.\nHierarchy of authorityrefers to the chain of command that places one individual or office in charge of\nanother, who in turn must answer to her own superiors. For example, as an employee at Walmart, your shift\nmanager assigns you tasks. Your shift manager answers to his store manager, who must answer to her regional\nmanager, and so on, up to the CEO who must answer to the board members, who in turn answer to the\nstockholders. Everyone in this bureaucracy follows the chain of command.\nBureaucracies have aclear division of labor: each individual has a specialized task to perform. For example,\nat a university, psychology professors teach psychology, but they do not attempt to provide students with\nfinancial aid forms. The Office of Admissions often takes on this task. In this case, it is a clear and\ncommonsense division. But what about in a restaurant where food is backed up in the kitchen and a hostess is\nstanding nearby texting on her phone? Her job is to seat customers, not to deliver food. Is this a smart division\nof labor?\nBureaucracies haveexplicit rules, rules that are outlined, written down, and standardized. For example, at\nyour college or university, the student guidelines are contained within the Student Handbook. As technology\nchanges and campuses encounter new concerns like cyberbullying, identity theft, and other problems that\narise, organizations scramble to ensure their explicit rules cover these emerging issues.\nFinally, bureaucracies are also characterized byimpersonality, which takes personal feelings out of\nprofessional situations. This characteristic grew, to some extent, out of a desire to avoid nepotism, backroom\ndeals, and other types of favoritism, while simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the\norganization. Impersonality Bureaucracies can effectively and efficiently serve volumes of customers quickly.\nHowever, explicit rules, clear division of labor, and a strict hierarchy of authority does not allow them to easily\nadjust to unique or new situations. As a result, customers frequently complain that stores with bureaucratic\nstructures, like Walmart, care little about individuals, other businesses, and the community at large.\nBureaucracies are oftenmeritocracies, meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and\ndocumented skills, rather than on nepotism or random choice. In order to get into a prestigious college, you\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n\n6.3 • Formal Organizations 161\nneed to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript. In order to become a lawyer and represent\nclients, you must graduate law school and pass the state bar exam. Of course, there are many well-documented\nexamples of success by those who did not proceed through traditional meritocracies. Think about technology\ncompanies with founders who dropped out of college, or performers who became famous after a YouTube\nvideo went viral.\nIn addition, organizations that aspire to become meritocracies encounter challenges. How well do you think\nestablished meritocracies identify talent? Wealthy families hire tutors, interview coaches, test-prep services,\nand consultants to help their kids get into the best schools. This starts as early as kindergarten in New York\nCity, where competition for the most highly-regarded schools is especially fierce. Are these schools, many of\nwhich have copious scholarship funds that are intended to make the school more democratic, really offering\nall applicants a fair shake?\nThere are several positive aspects of bureaucracies. They are intended to improve efficiency, ensure equal\nopportunities, and serve a large population. And there are times when rigid hierarchies are needed. But\nremember that many of our bureaucracies grew large at the same time that our school model was\ndeveloped––during the Industrial Revolution. Young workers were trained, and organizations were built for\nmass production, assembly line work, and factory jobs. In these scenarios, a clear chain of command was\ncritical. Now, in the information age, this kind of rigid training and adherence to protocol can actually decrease\nboth productivity and efficiency.\nToday’s workplace requires a faster pace, more problem solving, and a flexible approach to work. Too much\nadherence to explicit rules and a division of labor can leave an organization behind. And unfortunately, once\nestablished, bureaucracies can take on a life of their own. Maybe you have heard the expression “trying to turn\na tanker around mid-ocean,” which refers to the difficulties of changing direction with something large and set\nin its ways. State governments and current budget crises are examples of this challenge. It is almost impossible\nto make quick changes, leading states to fail, year after year, to address increasingly unbalanced budgets.\nFinally, bureaucracies, grew as institutions at a time when privileged white males held all the power. While\nostensibly based on meritocracy, bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only\nrecognizing the merit in traditionally male and privileged paths.\nMichels (1911) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by theIron Rule of Oligarchy,wherein\nan entire organization is ruled by a few elites. Do you think this is true? Can a large organization be\ncollaborative?\nFIGURE6.9This McDonald’s storefront in Egypt shows the McDonaldization of society. (Credit: s_w_ellis/flickr)\n\n162 6 • Groups and Organization\nThe McDonaldization of Society\nTheMcDonaldization of Society(Ritzer 1993) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business\nmodel in common social institutions, including government, education, and even relationships. The term itself\nisn't widely used in publications, research, or common conversation, but its effects are very familiar, even\ncommonplace. The McDonald's model includes efficiency (the division of labor), predictability, calculability,\nand control (monitoring). For example, in your average chain grocery store, people at the register check out\ncustomers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order\n(efficiency). Whenever you enter a store within that grocery chain, you receive the same type of goods, see the\nsame store organization, and find the same brands at the same prices (predictability). You will find that goods\nare sold by the pound, so that you can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at\nthe price for that bag of onions. The employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime\npay (calculability). Finally, you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform, and usually a name\ntag, so that they can be easily identified. There are security cameras to monitor the store, and some parts of the\nstore, such as the stockroom, are generally considered off-limits to customers (control). This approach is so\ncommon in chain stores that you might not even notice it; in fact, if you went to a large-chain resturant or a\nstore like Walmart, seeing a worker or a process that didn’t have these uniform characteristics would seem\nodd.\nWhile McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of various goods and\nservices to more people worldwide, it has also reduced the variety of goods available in the marketplace while\nrendering available products uniform, generic, and bland. Think of the difference between a mass-produced\nshoe and one made by a local cobbler, between a chicken from a family-owned farm and a corporate grower, or\nbetween a cup of coffee from the local diner and one from Starbucks. Some more contemporary efforts can be\nreferred to as “de-McDonaldization”: farmers markets, microbreweries, and various do-it-yourself trends. And\nwith recent advertising and products emphasizing individuality, even McDonald’s seems to be de-\nMcDonaldizing itself.\nThe corporate impact of this phenomenon is interesting on its own, but sociologists and ordinary citizens are\noften more concerned about its echoes in other areas of society. A primary example, discussed extensively\nlater on in this text, is education. Curricula and teaching practices were long the domain of local districts\nunder state guidance. Some experts felt that this led to both inefficiency and underperformance. Starting in\nthe 1990s and especially in the early 2000s with the No Child Left Behind law, national standards began to\noverride local approaches. But the desired outcome (improved education) is difficult to measure and far more\ndifficult to achieve. Due to funding gaps, difficult standards, and intense public and local government\nopposition, the law was largely seen as having limited impact and was eventually phased out.\nHealthcare has also gone to a mass production and efficiency model. As you will explore later in the text, U.S.\nhealthcare providers and insurers faced overwhelming increases in demand, partly the result of America’s\naging and less healthy population. In the 1990s, providers consolidated in what was called hospital “merger\nmania.” Local hospitals and even small doctors’ offices were merged or acquired by larger systems (Fuchs\n1997). The trend continued with new growth in providers like urgent care offices. Other efficiency and\nstandardization methods include telemedicine, new types of healthcare professionals, insurance mandates,\nand artificial intelligence.\nAccess for free at openstax.org."

      "reference_material_content": "15.2 • International Law 469\n15.2International Law\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n• Define and identify sources of international law.\n• Explain how state sovereignty informs international law.\n• Differentiate between the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n• Discuss the development of key areas of international law, including the law of the sea, the Geneva\nConventions, and human rights law.\nInternational law is a set of formal and informal rules that loosely govern the international system, setting\nparameters around the conduct of state and non-state actors. In the absence of a central global government,\ninternational lawplays a critical role in increasing the predictability of international relations, helping to\ncounteract theanarchyof the system by prescribing norms and setting expectations of behavior. It facilitates\nstate interactions in “common” places, such as the air and the sea, and helps promote peace and lessen the\nimpact of conflict. International laws govern airline travel, commerce, maritime law, human rights, the\ndevelopment and use of weapons, and the environment, among other areas.\nInternational law is not found in a single book or document; rather, it is the sum total of international treaties,\nother international agreements, andcustomary law, which is derived from the long-time practices of states\n(seeChapter 11: Courts and Law). International law has developed out of functional necessity, as in the cases of\ninternational transportation, commerce, or communications, for example, or because of broad consensus\naround moral or immoral behavior, as in issues of human rights and the laws of war.\nTwo courts adjudicate international law: theInternational Court of Justice(ICJ), which has jurisdiction over\ndisputes between states, and theInternational Criminal Court(ICC), which has jurisdiction over individual\ncriminal behavior such as war crimes or genocide. Some other international organizations such as the\nEuropean Unionand theWorld Trade Organizationalso have legal systems that adjudicate disputes between\nmember states.\n\n470 15 • International Law and International Organizations\nHow Does International Law Establish the Rights and Obligations of States?\nThe recognition of state sovereignty provides the foundation for international law. Typically, sovereign states\nwillingly enter into agreements that they believe will benefit them in some way, with the understanding that by\nsigning a treaty they agree to its terms, including obligations and constraints on their behavior. TheUnited\nNations(UN), a global organization bringing together nearly every state in the world to promote peace and\nstability, hosts a repository of more than 500 active treaties across every conceivable issue in international\nrelations.4Signatory states may monitor or punish states that do not fulfill their treaty obligations. In this way,\nall individual, sovereign parties to a treaty ensure that they are treated fairly under the terms of the agreement\nand that they receive the benefits they are due.\nSome treaties require states to modify their domestic policies. For instance, states that sign theParis Climate\nAccordcommit to solve a common problem,climate change, by taking certain steps in their own country.\nSignatory countries that fail to take those steps may be acting within their sovereign rights, but if they signed\nthe treaty, those domestic actions (or that domestic inaction) are now regulated by international law. States\nthat sign international conventions like theUniversal Declaration of Human Rightsor theConvention to\nEliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)commit to follow the guidelines set forth in\nthose documents.\nExamples of International Law\nThree particularly well-developed areas of international law are thelaw of the sea, theGeneva Conventions,\nandhuman rights law. They illustrate how functional needs and moral obligations have driven the\ndevelopment of international law and helped states acquire global goods.\nThe United Nations convened the first conference on the law of the sea in 1958. TheUN Convention on the Law\nof the Sea(UNCLOS) was signed in 1982 and came into force in 1994. Among other things, the UNCLOS\nclarifies where countries’ boundaries extend into the ocean, who “owns” the fish in the water, and who has the\nright to use sea traffic lanes. UNCLOS identifies state “rights, freedoms and obligations” in areas such as\nshipping, fishing, wrecks and cultural heritage, and the protection of the marine environment.5\nAll UN member states sign the Geneva Conventions, a series of treaties and protocols that codify international\nhumanitarian law. Through the efforts of theInternational Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC), the first Geneva\nConvention was signed in 1864, allowing noncombatants to treat wounded soldiers in the battlefield. There are\nnow four Geneva Convention treaties—the fourth of which establishes a legal definition of war crimes—all\nfocused on protecting civilians and prisoners of war during military conflicts.\nThe Geneva Conventions serve as the basis for a much broader body of international human rights law that\nincludes nine core human rights treaties that extend beyond wartime behavior. These treaties recognize the\n“inalienable rights” of people and codify crimes against humanity. They call upon all states to prevent\ngenocide, which they define as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical,\nracial or religious group,”6and to punish those who perpetrate it.\nAll UN member states have ratified at least one of the nine core human rights treaties, and 80 percent have\nratified four or more, accepting the obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect, and\npromote human rights.7In 2001, the international community developed a principle calledResponsibility to\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n15.2 • International Law 471\nProtect (R2P), which justifies international intervention to protect human rights. Arising from the horror at\nthe complacency of the international community during the Rwandan genocide and the ethnic cleansing in the\nformer Yugoslavia during the 1990s, in 2005 world leaders at the UN World Summit unanimously agreed to\nadopt R2P.8The philosophy behind R2P is that “state sovereignty carrie[s] with it the obligation of the State to\nprotect its own people, and that if the State [is] unwilling or unable to do so, the responsibility shift[s] to the\ninternational community to use diplomatic, humanitarian and other means to protect them.”9R2P obliges\nstate governments to prevent crimes against humanity, and if they do not, it specifies that the United Nations\nSecurity Council may intervene to protect at-risk populations.\nHow Is International Law Enforced?\nEnforcing international law requires the will and power of states. This can be a challenge for a variety of\nreasons including the risk of hostile confrontation, the potential damage to valuable international\nrelationships, and the reluctance to interfere with state sovereignty by intervening in domestic affairs. States\nare rarely punished for violations of international human rights law that happen within their borders.\nBeginning in 2017, the Myanmar government launched a campaign against the Rohingya, an ethnic minority,\nand in the years since observers have accused the government of burning down villages and engaging in\nsystematic rape and torture in violation of human rights treaties Myanmar has signed. In cases like these, in\nwhich a government violates an international law within its own borders, the international community may be\nunwilling or unable to enforce treaty obligations.10The groups suffering these human rights abuses are\ntypically without political or military power and have little recourse if the international community is unwilling\nto come to their aid, even if there is broad agreement that international law is being broken.\nInternational law is the “judicial branch” of global governance. Within a country, judicial decisions are\nmeaningful when, if necessary, the executive branch has the ability to enforce them. Because there is no\nexecutive branch in the global governance system, international laws are difficult to enforce. Sometimes\npowerful states decide to enforce international law, but this is not guaranteed and often depends upon power\nimbalances (powerful states are more likely to get away with noncompliance than weak states), state interests\n(states that are allied with powerful states may get away with noncompliance more than enemies), and the\nperceived ease of halting the bad behavior.\n\n472 15 • International Law and International Organizations\nFIGURE15.2In August 1990, SaddamHussein, the leader of Iraq, invaded Kuwait, violating international law. The\nUN Security Council set a January 15, 1991, deadline for Iraqi withdrawal. On January 17, a UN coalition of 39\ncountries, led by the United States, launchedOperation Desert Stormto force Iraq out of Kuwait and show\n“intolerance for military aggression and the strengthening of international cohesion, international law and liberal\ninstitutions, including the UN.”11In this photo, soldiers and civilians raise American, British, Saudi, and Kuwaiti flags\nto celebrate following the retreat of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

The ICJ was the original judicial institution of the United Nations.\nFIGURE15.3The Peace Palace in The Hague is the home of the International Court of Justice. (credit: “Peace\nPalace” by Cliché Lybil Ber/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)\nThe ICJ was founded in 1945 to resolve disputes between states. Any UN member state can bring a case to the\nICJ. The ICJ’s jurisdiction is limited to interstate disputes and advisory opinions for United Nations bodies. The\nmost common types of cases states bring before the ICJ involve boundary and resource disputes. About a third\nof UN member states—not including the United States—have signed a document agreeing to be bound by the\nICJ’s rulings. Since its founding, the ICJ has issued approximately 160 rulings, including both resolutions to\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n15.3 • The United Nations and Global Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) 473\ninterstate disputes and advisory opinions.12\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC)\nWhen egregious human rights crimes are perpetuated on domestic groups and do not cross state boundaries,\nthey are particularly challenging to punish as the doctrine of state sovereignty protects internal affairs.\nFollowing the 1994 Rwandan genocide and “ethnic cleansing” in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the\nUN established international criminal tribunals to help bring the perpetrators to justice and to endimpunity,\nor the lack of punishment for criminal behavior. Given the costs and logistics associated with these temporary\nand issue-specific courts, in 1998 the United Nations Rome Statute established the International Criminal\nCourt (ICC) as a permanent court to oversee such cases.\nThe ICC was designed to address problems outside the scope of the ICJ, particularly to bring to justice\nindividuals accused of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. In 2018, the ICC’s jurisdiction was\nexpanded to cover the crime of aggression. Thus far, the ICC has heard 30 cases and is investigating multiple\nothers.13\nOver 120 states are party to the Rome Statute, but powerful states with global reach like Russia, China, and the\nUnited States have been reluctant to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC, fearing it will infringe on state\nsovereignty and be used as a political weapon against soldiers or other nationals abroad. The United States has\nestablished a network of bilateral treaties with countries around the world promising not to prosecute any US\ncitizen through the ICC.14\nHow Does International Law Contribute to Global Governance?\nAs doctoral researcher HeathPickeringnotes, “agreements to norms and treaties have ... increased\ninternational institutions, given rise to non-state actors, and rapidly developed the contemporary customary\nand treaty based rules system.”15Given the relative lack of enforcement mechanisms, state compliance with\ninternational law is surprisingly high. Most states comply with their obligations most of the time, and state\nleaders typically couch their actions in the language of international law, feeling compelled to justify their\nbehavior according to accepted norms. The more states comply and feel the need to explain their behavior in\ncommon terms accepted by the international community, the more predictable international relations will be."

Before we had a good way to measure public opinion, constituent letters were one of the few\nways officials could gauge how the public felt. The advent ofpublic opinion polls provided a scientific way of\nidentifying and measuring opinions. Social scientist JeanConverse, in her history of the field, writes that\nsurveys can be traced back 2,000 years but were forged in the 20th century as a way to understand mass\npopulations and societies and to gain insight into elites.127Over time, polls and surveys have become more\nprecise through careful sampling and improved techniques. Asampleis a group selected by a researcher to\nrepresent the characteristics of the entire population, and because we can never poll the entire population,\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n5.5 • How Do We Measure Public Opinion? 159\ngetting the right sample is important to the accuracy of any poll. But how can we accurately gauge the opinions\nof the whole country on a sample of 1,400 or 2,000 people? The way the sample is drawn affects its accuracy. In\nthe most common method,probability sampling, researchers randomly choose samples from the larger\npopulation. This method requires that everyone has an equal chance of being part of the sample and that they\nare randomly selected, which allows researchers to make generalizations about the larger population. If a\nresearcher chooses people at random from a population, it is likely that their views will match the opinions of\nthe larger population as a whole. These types of samples are often generated throughrandom digit dialing, in\nwhich respondents are chosen at random by a computerized phone number generator. Researchers then use\nthese randomly generated phone numbers to reach people at home and ask them about their opinions. While\nrandom digit dialing has been the go-to for decades, the decrease in landlines, increased adoption of cell\nphones, and increased time that people are at work have all contributed to the decreased reliance on home-\nbased phone numbers. ALos Angeles Timesarticle found that Internet-based surveys and automated\ninterviewing systems (as opposed to live pollsters) were particularly accurate and may reflect a shift in how\nresearchers measurepublic opinionmoving forward.128\nThe difficulty of reaching people for polls is not just an American phenomenon. Researchers in Japan have\nfound steep decreases in responses to nationally conducted surveys, with the steepest declines in\nmetropolitan areas and among younger demographics. Scholars point to increased commute times, longer\nwork hours, and higher mobility among younger Japanese as contributing to this problem.129Sampling in\ncountries facing violence or instability can be a serious—and dangerous—problem for pollsters. JamesBell,\ndirector of international survey research for the Pew Research Center, notes that when Pew conducted polls\nduring civil unrest in Ukraine and Venezuela, polls needed to be conducted face-to-face rather than by phone.\nIn addition, sometimes the data acquired in polls must be processed locally if pollsters cannot immediately\nevacuate the area.130\nWHAT CAN I DO?\nThe Importance of Empirical and Quantitative Skills\nFIGURE5.12This graph shows support for political parties in New Zealand between 2009 and 2012, according to\nvarious political polls. (credit: “File:NZ opinion polls 2009-2011 -parties.png” Mark Payne, Denmark/Wikimedia\nCommons, CC BY 3.0)\nEveryone loves a good public opinion poll. As you’ll see in other chapters, data from polls are utilized throughout\n\n160 5 • Political Participation and Public Opinion\nsociety, from the media to candidates running for office, and even to decide what gets included in legislation.\nHowever, being able to properly understand what the data are telling us is a skill that is developed and can be\nutilized in a wide range of areas. If you can look at a set of numerical data or observable facts and reach an informed\nconclusion about what is happening—for example, about whether a group of voters prefers a certain candidate or if a\ngroup of residents wants a park built in their town—this is really no different from determining if a group of\nconsumers prefers brand X bread or brand Y bread. In the modern digital era, we have a wealth of information at our\nfingertips. Being able to properly understand and interpret that information is a skill that is becoming fundamental in\ntoday’s workforce.\nThere are also “nontraditional” sampling methods, which may be less scientific but offer certain benefits. One\nnontraditional method is aconvenience sample, which, as the name suggests, is a sample based on\nconvenience rather than probability. If you do not have the funds to create a poll based on aprobability sample\nandrandom digit dialing, you might instead ask your classmates or your coworkers to respond to your survey\nwith their opinions on the last election. While this method is both convenient and easy, we cannot extrapolate\nmuch from the information beyond the sample from which it is drawn. Another type of polling method is\ncalledcluster sampling, in which researchers divide the overall population into clusters, based on\ncharacteristics such as shared cities or schools, then randomly select people from within those clusters to poll.\nThis type of sampling is cheaper than probability sampling, but the results are also not quite as representative\nbecause they are not randomly drawn.\nHow reliable are polls? One of the most basic issues with a poll is a sample that is too small, which leads to\nsampling errors. Generally speaking, the larger the sample, the less chance of error. A typical sample of 1,500\npeople will have a sampling error of approximately 2.6 percent, which is generally considered an “acceptable”\nmargin of error in public opinion polling. This means that out of 1,500 respondents, if 60 percent say that the\nLA Lakers is their favorite NBA team, due to sampling error, the true figure could be anywhere between 57.4\npercent and 62.6 percent who prefer the Lakers. The smaller the sample, the larger the error.\nThe methods by which respondents are contacted can also affect a poll’s accuracy. According to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2020, 83 percent of Americans aged 30–34, 74.5 percent of those\naged 35–44, and almost 60 percent of those aged 45–64 used cell phones exclusively.131This trend away from\nlandlines can contribute toselection bias, whereby the sample drawn is not representative of the population\nbeing studied. In this case, any sample drawn from people using landlines would probably skew heavily toward\nindividuals who are much older and those who are likely to be at home more often.\nThe design of the survey itself can limit a poll’s accuracy. Question wording, interviewer bias, and response\nbias can all lead tomeasurement error, or limitations in response validity due to survey design problems.\nQuestions should be worded in a straightforward manner in order to solicit a truthful response. Studies have\nshown that alterations in question wording, also known asquestion wording effects, change how people\nrespond to polls and surveys. For example, University of Chicago Professor KennethRasinkifound that even\nthe slightest changes in wording altered people’s support for government spending,132while Cornell\nUniversity Professor JonathonSchuldt, Indiana University Professor SaraKonrath, and University of Southern\nCalifornia Professor NorbertSchwarzfound that responses changed depending on whether they used the term\n“global warming” or the term “climate change.”133Bias that stems from the identity of the individual\nconducting the interview known asinterviewer bias, can also change people’s opinions. For example,\nPrinceton University Professor DanielKatzfound that the social class of the interviewer had an effect on\nsurvey response,134while a study of breast cancer patients found that response rates to surveys were higher\nwhen the race of the person administering the survey was the same as that of the respondent.135Similar\neffects have been found when interviewers are of different genders.136In other words, people sometimes\nrespond differently based on the gender of the person conducting the survey.\nInaccuracies can also arise fromresponse bias, when respondents inaccurately report their true opinions for\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n5.6 • Why Is Public Opinion Important? 161\none reason or another. One famous example of response bias is called the “Bradley effect.” This theory refers to\na phenomenon observed in the 1982 California gubernatorial race between TomBradley, a Black man, and\nGeorgeDeukmejian, a White man of Armenian descent. In polls leading up to this race, Bradley was shown to\nbe in the lead, but he ultimately lost by a narrow margin. The theory behind the Bradley effect is that White\nvoters are unlikely to admit to bias against minority candidates, and as such, polls may overestimate support\nfor a minority candidate. Also known associal desirability bias, this type of response bias occurs when\nrespondents give the answer they think theyshouldgive, and not what they really feel."

      "reference_material_content": "1.2 • Public Policy, Public Interest, and Power 13\n1.2Public Policy, Public Interest, and Power\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n• Define public policy, public interest, and power.\n• Define sovereignty.\n• Distinguish among the terms country, state, nation, and nation-state.\n• Define political conflict.\n• Define the status quo.\n• Identify three bargaining outcomes.\nPublic policy is one of the main products of politics. Public policy includes all the decisions governments make\nto influence behavior. When a legislature enacts legislation, an executive issues an order, or a court announces\na ruling, they are all makingpublic policy.\nIn making public policy, political actors typically invoke thepublic interest(also called the common good or\nthe general welfare). The public interest is an amorphous concept, although it is generally defined as the well-\nbeing of the public.18It is invisible to our senses, and it is possible to maintain that it does not exist because\nthere is no interest (or good or welfare) beyond what individuals want for themselves.\nThose who claim to seek the public interest typically believe that it is not just what people want, however, but\nwhat theyshouldwant. It would not be in the public interest, in this view, to create a society in which those in\npowercan exploit others or one that legitimizes cruelty, even if a majority of the population wanted these\nthings. It is in the public interest to create a good society, one with social justice, in which the government\nserves the people. Such a society would provide for the common good and promote the general welfare.\nPower, a fundamentally important term in the study of politics, can be defined as the ability to compel\nsomeone to do something that they would not otherwise choose to do.19Those with power are the ones who get\nto make public policy. Power cannot be counted, weighed, or photographed. Though it is invisible, the\naccoutrements of power—for example, being addressed as president of the United States or having people\nsalute you—can often be seen. Some people have a lot of power, while others have very little. Power is not a\nconstant force, as politicians sometimes increase their power, while at other times their power slips away.\nPower is, in part, a matter of belief: if you believe someone has power over you, they do, at least to the extent\nthat you do what they want.\n\n14 1 • What Is Politics and What Is Political Science?\nFIGURE1.6Upon his arrival in Israel, Brazilian President JairBolsonarowas greeted with many accoutrements of\npower, including military presence, flags, and a red carpet. (credit: “31/03/2019 Cerimônia Oficial de chegada” by\nPalácio do Planalto/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nThe highest form of power is calledsovereignpower. If no other entity (person or institution) has authority\nover a state, that state is said to have sovereignty, and the supreme authority in that state is called the\nsovereign.20In many countries, the sovereign is the highest-ranking individual leader, such as the queen or\nking. In the United States and in other democracies, the people are sovereign, not their elected officials. The\npeople elect their leaders, and the people can unseat them either by selecting others in the next election or by\nremoving them—for example, through impeachment, a legal process for removing elected officials from their\nposts for misconduct.\nThe power of any governmental institution depends on thede jureandde factorules of the country. In Saudi\nArabia, for example, the Consultative Assembly has neither the power to pass nor to enforce laws. Its members\nare appointed by the king, who is an absolute monarch (the sovereign), and he can remove them at his\npleasure.21In the United States, as discussed inChapter 9: Legislatures, the Congress has substantial powers:\nonly it can approve the spending of governmental money or declare war. The president can veto legislation\napproved by Congress, but Congress has the power to override a president’sveto.\nGovernment and the Legitimate Use of Power\nThegovernmentis the most important institution in any discussion of politics because it is the only one with\nlegal, legitimate authority to use coercive power to compel behavior within a defined geographic area.\nThe government of a place typically exercises its powers over individuals who live within its borders or who are\notherwise subject to its laws (for example, a citizen of the country who is currently living abroad). If you break\nyour family’s rules, your family can punish you, but only your government can imprison you for breaking\ngovernment laws. Your church may ask you to contribute money, but only the government can compel you to\npay taxes. Your business can encourage you to uphold their rules and fight for their interests, but only the\ngovernment can require you to serve in the military and sit on juries.\nA government is one of the four elements that, along with territory, population, and sovereignty, make up a\nstate (or its synonym, country). The United States is a state, and so are the individual territories, from Alabama\nto Wyoming, within it. Afghanistan and Zimbabwe are states too, as are all the other 190 some countries\nbetween them alphabetically.22Statehas other meanings that are also relevant to politics and political science.\nFor example, a country might be called a police state. In a police state, the government uses force, often\nimposed by the military or the secret police, to repress dissent and maintain order. In a welfare state, the\ngovernment provides extensive social benefits like child care, education, housing, and pensions. Countries are\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n1.2 • Public Policy, Public Interest, and Power 15\nmore or less police and welfare states, as all countries use a police force to maintain order and all countries\noffer their citizens some social benefits.\nNorth Korea, where the government monitors virtually every aspect of life and imprisons or executes those\nwho oppose its leaders, is perhaps the most extreme example of a police state. Nordic countries, including\nDenmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden, are generally considered to be the most generous welfare\nstates.\nThe termscountry,state,nation, andnation-stateare sometimes used synonymously, but they are not at all\nidentical. Acountryis a defined geographic territory with a sovereign government. The termstateis often\nused to refer to a smaller area within a country, as in the case of the individual American states, which all\ntogether make up the United States of America, the country. The termstatecan also be used to refer to an\nentire country. For example, India is a state. Anation, in contrast, refers to a population connected by history,\nculture, and beliefs that generally lives in a specific area, such as Kurdistan in the Middle East, where the\nKurdish are the dominant ethnic group even though they do not have a country to call their own.23A nation\nthat also is a country is sometimes called anation-state. The United States, France, Pakistan, China, and many\nothers are generally considered simultaneously to be countries, states, nations, and nation-states.\nA government hasauthoritywhen those subject to its power recognize that power. In a class, you accept your\nteacher’s power to give assignments and assign grades—or, at least, your school recognizes these powers.\nAuthority is generally limited to specific circumstances and places where the authority is said to have\njurisdiction. As a condition for passing this course, your teacher can require you to read this book but not to do\ntheir laundry. Your government can require you to pay your taxes—it has this authority—but it cannot require\nyou to do things that are unlawful.24\nWhen authority is used in ways that are consistent with the duties or rules of the institution, that authority is\nsaid to belegitimate. If a police officer pulls your car over because you are speeding, that is a legitimate use of\nauthority; if that officer pulls you over because you are “driving while black,” that would be an illegitimate\nuse.25\nFIGURE1.7Pulling over drivers because of their skin color is an illegitimate use of governmental authority. (credit:\n“Ride” by Krista Baltroka/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nIn politics, there is a continual struggle over which uses of authority are legitimate and which are not, and, as\ndiscussed inChapter 13: Governing Regimes, governments resolve these conflicts in different ways depending\n\n16 1 • What Is Politics and What Is Political Science?\non how democratic they are. What can a government compel you to do, allow you to do, or prohibit you from\ndoing? One possible answer is that if a government enacts a policy in accordance with its own rules, then that\npolicy is legitimate. In this view, individuals could enslave others so long as governmental policy allowed this\npractice, as some countries have. Another answer is that some policies, such as slavery, are fundamentally\nillegitimate, even if they are lawfully enacted.\nConflict and Bargaining\nDisagreement—that is,conflict—is fundamental to politics for two primary reasons. As long as there is desire\nand people want things they do not have, there will be conflict. Millions of people lack clean air, access to\npotable water, and even basic necessities such as food and shelter. Scarcity is not limited to human needs.\nEven if every family in the world was wealthy enough to buy as big a mansion as (they thought) they wanted,\ndifferences would still exist that would make some people want what others have—say a better view, a bigger\nlot, or proximity to certain amenities.\nIn addition to desire, conflict will always exist because people have differing beliefs and preferences—that is,\ndiffering values. Should abortion be legal? A spectrum of passionate views on the subject exists, and there is no\nway one political decision will satisfy all individuals at every point along that spectrum. Should governments\nspend taxpayer money on bike trails, mass transportation, or roads? The answer might not be a matter of deep\nbelief, but it still elicits differing preferences. Again, no one political action is likely to satisfy everyone.\nThroughout history, the resolution of conflicts has often involved brute force. Violence can resolve conflicts, at\nleast temporarily, with the strong getting what they want through brutality.\nPolitics is the process for resolving conflicts over scarce resources and differing values without resorting to\nviolence. When violence is used to solve disputes, it represents the failure of politics, or at least the deep\nfrustration of those whose aspirations are thwarted by politics. Politics can determine how scarce resources\nwill be allocated and which values will prevail. Through political processes, a country can decide whether\nabortions will be allowed in all cases, some cases, or no cases. This does not mean that everyone will now agree\non whether the policy is good or not; politics can resolve issues, but it cannot eliminate the underlying\nconflicts that cause them.\nIn recent decades the world has gotten richer and more peaceful.26That does not mean conflict is\ndisappearing; several countries are experiencing open military conflict, and many other countries are\nexperiencing high levels of violence. Even in countries without open, violent conflict,political polarizationis\nincreasing.27Political polarization occurs when groups—political parties as well as ethnic or religious\ngroups—become divided (“polarized”) in ways that increase cohesion within the groups and also increase\nsuspicion and distrust across the groups. The United States today is more polarized than it has been in many\nyears.28The greater the polarization, the greater the difficulty of resolving conflicts: polarization is a risk to\npeaceful politics.\nHow does politics resolve conflicts? Most often, throughbargaining. When parties involved in a conflict\nengage in negotiations concerning thestatus quo—that is, the existing set of circumstances involved in the\nconflict—they are bargaining. Political bargaining determines whether existing rules and reality will be\nchanged.\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n\n1.2 • Public Policy, Public Interest, and Power 17\nFIGURE1.8Bargaining at the market is like bargaining in politics: each participant wants a solution that benefits\nthemselves. (credit: “Learning to Haggle at the Nubian Market” by Bonnie Ann Cain-Wood/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nIn political bargaining, there are three likely outcomes. The first is that those bargaining simply cannot come\nto any agreement. When this happens, and it often does, the status quo prevails. Negotiations are almost\ncertain to collapse when those bargaining are unwilling to give an inch because they have diametrically\nopposed goals. If one side seeks to raise taxes, for example, and the other to lower them, then there is no deal\nthat would be acceptable to both sides. In this situation, those who favor the status quo are the winners, so\nthose who favor the status quo have reason to prevent the negotiations from succeeding.\nThis point bears repeating. Although you might see a world full of problems that obviously need to be fixed,\nyou should always assume that there are those who benefit from the current circumstances who will work to\nthwart change. This bias in favor of the status quo is one of the reasons political change is often so difficult to\nachieve. Think of it this way: bargaining seeks to change the rules, and there are almost certainly those who\nbenefit from those rules and want to keep them.\nA second possibility involvescompromise, in which the various participants in a conflict give ground on what\nthey seek in order to arrive at an agreement. Compromise is most likely to occur when those bargaining\ngenerally agree on the goals but have disagreements on the specific details. If some countries seek to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions to limit globalclimate changewhile other countries seek faster economic growth\nthat increases their emissions, the participants are seeking different goals and compromise is unlikely.\nHowever, if all countries want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they are in general agreement about their\ngoals. In this case, compromise is more likely. If no country has the power unilaterally to set emission limits,\nthe countries may have motivation to split the difference. If your country wants to lower emissions by 10\npercent and my country wants to lower them by 5 percent, the two countries might make a deal and lower\nthem by 7.5 percent. Each country gets part, but not all, of what they want.\n\n18 1 • What Is Politics and What Is Political Science?\nA third outcome results from what is calledlogrolling. If you have something I want and I have something you\nwant, we each have something with which to bargain. For example, suppose you have a peach and an apple, as\ndo I. We each like both fruits and want more of both—there is scarcity. But you really like apples and I really\nlike peaches. Through logrolling, I give you my apple, and in exchange you give me your peach. This is not a\nperfect solution, as we both wanted more applesandmore peaches. But in the end we each are better off than\nwe were before the bargaining.\nThe outcome of political negotiations depends again on the core principles of politics discussed earlier—the\nrules governing the negotiation, the reality at the time of the negotiation, and the strategic choices those\ninvolved in the negotiation make.\nPolitical negotiations are often a combination of high-minded principles and skullduggery. Negotiators will\nseek to persuade others and, if persuasion does not work, sometimes to bully or buy them. If any participants\nin a negotiation have the power to force the others to give ground, they very likely will use it.\nIf the status quo prevails, those participants who sought change may be seen as weak and be blamed for their\nfailure. If compromises are achieved, participants may be criticized for “selling out”—for compromising not\nonly their policies but also their principles. Logrolling can create the impression of impropriety, of corrupt\ndealmaking, or of unseemly quid pro quo, as in “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.”\nYet each outcome has an alternative explanation. If the status quo prevails, those who defended it will laud\ntheir accomplishments. When compromises succeed, each side can claim that “it is better to get half a loaf of\nbread than no loaf at all.” After a successful logroll, the negotiators can say, “We got what we valued most.”\nNegotiations can produce winners and losers, but they can also produce outcomes that leave the participants\nat least relatively satisfied with the outcomes.\nIf all political power were concentrated in a single person, with the government proceeding byfiat, or\ncommand, and the supreme leader giving the orders, bargaining might seem unnecessary. Yet even in\ntotalitarian countries the supreme leader will have advisors, and those advisors will negotiate among\nthemselves and the ruler as they seek to influence how power is used.\nAccess for free at openstax.org"

      "reference_material_content": "330 C.E.-1600 C.E.\nThe Byzantine Empire 10\nand Russia\nGEOGRAPHY\nAs the Western half of the Roman Empire fell in 476 c.z., the Eastern part of the empire, the\nByzantine Empire, was flourishing. The Byzantine Empire was successful for three main\nreasons.\n1. Many of the rich aristocrats and merchants left Rome with their wealth intact,\nheading to Constantinople.\n2. Constantinople was located on the shores of the Bosphorus, a body of water that\nlinks the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Since the city was surrounded by\nmountains on three sides, it could only be attacked from the water, which was very\nheavily guarded and very safe.\n3. The Byzantine Empire had access to the trade routes coming to Europe from Asia:\nThe Silk Road from China, the Spice Route from India, wheat from Egypt, and even\nenslaved people and ironwork from Western Europe. Its geographical location\nallowed it to have access to money and trade that was not disrupted by the\nbarbarian invasions in Western Europe.\nThe Byzantine Empire experienced a quick rise to a golden age as it continued the Hellenistic\nblending of Greek, Roman, Asian, and even Christian culture. Eventually, the empire entered\na period of slow, steady decline ending in the 1400s.\nEMPEROR JUSTINIAN\nJustinian was the greatest Byzantine emperor. He reigned during its golden age from 527 c.r.\nto 565 c.£. Justinian tried to reconquer the Western half of the empire, but he was not suc-\ncessful. The attempt drained his treasury and nearly bankrupted him.\nThe power behind Justinian was his wife, Theodora, a former peasant. Theodora was not\nsimply his wife. She was also a political advisor and backed him up during a revolt in the\ncity of Constantinople. Justinian’s advisors told him to flee, but it was Theodora who con-\nvinced her husband to stay. Her distain for the rebellion was obvious, and Justinian brutally\nsubjugated the members of the rebellion, in large part due to his wife.\nTheodora turned out to be quite a politician. She was strong enough at times to challenge\nher husband’s authority, and she made her own decisions in an era when women did not\nhave a lot of power. Theodora proved to be an excellent diplomat, negotiating with the\nPersian Empire. She was quick to give humanitarian aid to areas that needed help, and she\nhelped build hospitals. Theodora advocated for the rights of women.\nTHE BYZANTINE EMPIRE AND RUSSIA 141\n\nCorpus Juris Civilis\nDuring his reign, Emperor Justinian decided to revise the confusing Roman legal code system.\nIn 529 c.k., he created what is known as the body of civil law: the Corpus Juris Civilis. He put\ntogether a Byzantine assembly to study the laws of the Roman assembly to find out what\nworked and what did not, what was contradictory and what was redundant, and then he\nstreamlined it. The Corpus Juris Civilis had a big impact on the church and Western European\ngovernment. Medieval monarchs during the nation-building period of European history\nmodeled their laws on its principles.\nJustinian’s Power\nEmperor Justinian wanted to use the Corpus Juris Civilis as a tool to unite his empire. He\nwas the sole ruler with complete authority, like the Roman emperors of old. He maintained\na large bureaucracy to help carry out his government, and it was fairly efficient. Justinian\neven enjoyed one other facet of power that was not present in the West: he had power over\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church. He was seen as the co-ruler with Christ on the Earth, so the\nByzantine Empire had a deeply intertwined church and state, whereas church and state were\nstaunchly and fiercely separated in the West. In the Byzantine Empire, there was one God\nand one religion.\nEASTERN ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church differed from the Roman Catholic Church in many ways.\n1. Church leadership. In the Byzantine Empire, the emperor was the head of the church.\nHe oversaw and controlled church affairs. The emperor appointed a patriarch, who\nwas the head official of the church, like a cardinal or an archbishop. The patriarch\nwas subservient to the emperor, just as a cardinal or archbishop was subservient to\nthe pope in the Roman Catholic Church.\n2. Church control over lives of Christians. Roman Catholics believed that the pope\ncontrolled the lives of all Christians, which is opposite of Eastern Orthodox\nChristians.\n3. Marriage of priests. Eastern Orthodox priests could marry and have families, but\nmonks and bishops could not.\n4. Bread for communion. Roman Catholics could not use leavened bread for\ncommunion, but Eastern Orthodox Christians could.\n5. Religious icons. Perhaps the biggest difference was the dispute over the use of\nreligious icons or holy images, statues, pictures, paintings, or stained-glass images of\nJesus, Mary, Joseph, and other saints. Byzantine Emperor Leo III outlawed the\npractice of using religious icons.\nTHE GREAT SCHISM\nThe Great Schism of 1054 c.z. occurred because of the different ways that Roman Catholics\nand Eastern Orthodox Christians used religion icons. When Byzantine Emperor Leo III out-\nlawed the practice of using religious icons, the Pope excommunicated the Emperor. This\ncaused much anger, and Emperor Leo II] excommunicated the Pope. This led to a permanent\nsplit between the two Christian churches, known as the Great Schism. The Great Schism\nstarted the collapse of the Byzantine Empire.\n142 SAT WORLD HISTORY\n\nTHE FIRST CRUSADE\nAfter the Great Schism of 1054, the Byzantine Empire began struggling for many reasons:\na A series of weak emperors took control\n= Continued religious differences with Western Europe\n= Conflicts with the Sassanid Empire of Asia\na Fear of the growing Islamic expansion\nIn 1090 c.g., Byzantine Emperor Comnenus had to ask the pope in Rome for assistance.\nIn asking for help, the Byzantine emperor recognized the pope’s authority.

      "reference_material_content": "184 World History Review\nTHE RISE OF THE OTTOMANS\nBy 1300, the Mongols had ended the power of the Seljuk Turks, who in turn had repeatedly chipped away at the\nterritory of the Byzantine empire. As the physical size of Byzantium began to shrink, its power steadily eroded as well.\nAnatolia was settled by nomadic Turkish tribes who were not unified under a central authority. Many of these\nAnatolian Turks sought to become warriors for Islam, or ghazi. In their zeal to conquer the territories of infidels,\nor non-Muslims, they targeted their raids on those who lived along the borders of the Byzantine empire. One of\nthe most noteworthy of the ghazi was Osman Bey, who ruled the Ottoman dynasty from 1281 to about 1326.\n(“Ottoman” is derived from “Osman.”) Osman’s dynasty would rule in unbroken succession from 1289 until\n1923. He and his successors formed alliances with other emir, or Muslim rulers, and engaged in one conquest\nafter another. In 1326, they conquered the Anatolian city of Bursa, which became their capital. In 1361, the\nOttomans added a second capital, Adrianople, which gained them a secure foothold in the Balkans.\nThe Ottomans owed their military success to their use of gunpowder and cannon. After they had conquered a group\nof people, they appointed local officials approved by their ruler, the sultan, to govern them. Most Muslims were\nrequired to serve in the Turkish army. Non-Muslims could be exempt from military service upon payment of a tax.\nTamerlane\nWhile the Ottomans were quickly rising to power, a rebellious warrior from Samarkand in central Asia came\nonto the scene in the early 15th century. Called Timur-i-Lang, or Timur the Lame, the Europeans dubbed him\nTamerlane. Claiming descent from Chinggis Khan, Tamerlane set about conquering Russia and Persia. He\nburned the city of Baghdad to the ground, and in 1378 moved through northern India, leaving a path of death\nand destruction. While in India, he massacred the population of Delhi, making a pyramid of their skulls. At the\nBattle of Ankara in 1402, Tamerlane crushed the Ottomans, effectively halting the expansion of the Ottoman\nempire. He then took the sultan back to Samarkand in an iron cage; there, the sultan died in captivity.\nThe Conquest of Constantinople\nWhen Tamerlane turned his attention to China, a power struggle ensued. After a civil war among the sons of\nthe Ottoman sultan, Mehmet | took the Ottoman throne. His son, Murad II, restored the power of the Ottoman\narmy. Mehmet Il, son of Murad lI, captured Constantinople in 1453, giving the Ottomans control of the\nBosporus Strait. Marching to Hagia Sophia, Mehmet declared the church a mosque. He then opened the city\nof Constantinople to new citizens of various religions and backgrounds. People from these varied backgrounds\nhelped rebuild the city of Constantinople, which was renamed Istanbul.\nThe Expansion of the Ottoman Empire\nAnother effective sultan was Selim the Grim, who came to power by murdering family members, including\nhis own father and sons. In 1514, at the Battle of Chaldiran, Selim defeated the Persians, afterwards sweeping\ninto Syria, Palestine, and North Africa and adding these areas to his empire. He continued by capturing the holy\ncities of Mecca and Medina. Upon taking Cairo, the Islamic world’s intellectual center, Egypt became part of\nthe Ottoman empire.\nT Ca h l e l ed O tt S o u m le a i n m an e mp t i h r e e L r a e w a g c i h v e e d r it b s y g r h e i a s t e s s u t b je h c e t i s g , h t h u e n d w e a r s th k e n o r w ul n e o t f o S t u h l e e i E m u a r n o pe I a , n w s h o as re S i u g l n e e i d m a f n r om t he 1 52 Ma 0 g n t i o f ic 1 e 5 n 6 t 6 . .\nKAPLAN)\n\nExpansion of the Islamic World 185\nHe expanded the Ottoman empire by conquering Baghdad in 1534 and the city of Belgrade in 1521 and advancing\ninto Hungarian and Austrian territory. In 1529, he briefly laid siege to Vienna; his failure to conquer Vienna ended\nOttoman hopes of expansion into Europe. The Ottomans also became a major naval power, capturing Tripoli and\nother areas along the North African coastline; through these conquests, they gained influence in the interior of Africa.\nOttoman Administration\nThe Ottomans would rule their empire for 600 years, during which they would build up an extensive bureaucracy,\nusing slave labor to further their control. Included among the sultan’s slaves were janissaries, or slaves taken\nfrom the people of conquered Christian territories. Under a policy called devshirme, the Ottoman sultan’s\narmy removed boys from their families, gave them an education, taught them the principles of Islam, and then\ntrained them for military service. The brightest and most capable janissaries could rise to prestigious posts in the\ngovernment. Non-Muslim girls were also taken from their families, but to become slaves in wealthy homes.\nThe Ottomans granted religious freedom to their subjects. Jews and Christians, as “people of the book,” were\nallowed to pursue their own religious beliefs and practices. Their status as millets, or nations, allowed them a\nrepresentative who served as a voice before the sultan and his bureaucrats. This arrangement promoted fairly\npeaceful relations between the sultan and his subjects, but did little to promote unity among the variety of\nethnic and religious groups in the Ottoman empire—a problem that would continue into the modern era.\nTHE SAFAVID EMPIRE\nDiscord within Dar al-Islam emerged with the creation of the Safavid empire. Named after their first ruler,\nSafi al-Din (1252-1334), the Safavids were originally members of the Sufi sect in northwestern Persia. Claiming\nthey were descended from Muhammad, the Safavids adopted the Shia branch of Islam. The Safavids were\nsubsequently persecuted by the Ottomans, who followed the Sunni form of the Islamic faith.\nBelieving that a powerful military was their best defense against the Ottomans, the Safavids set about\nstrengthening their army. Their foremost military leader, a 14-year-old named Ismail, would seize most of\npresent-day Iran and adopt the Persian title shah. The Ottoman Turks, fearing that the Safavids might alienate\nsome of their own followers, ordered the execution of Shia Muslims within the Ottoman empire, while Ismail\nwiped out the Sunni in Baghdad. Facing off against each other at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, the Ottomans\nand their artillery weakened the Safavids, but did not defeat them completely. The conflict between Ottomans\nand Safavids would continue for another 200 years.\nThe Rule of Shah Abbas\nIn spite of the animosity between Ottomans and Safavids, Shah Abbas the Great (reigned 1587-1629) created\na culture that blended the Persian tradition with that of the Ottomans and Arabs. Among the accomplishments\nof Shah Abbas were moving the Safavid capital to the more centrally located Isfahan, and incorporating into\nhis army royal slaves similar to the Ottoman janissaries. He also formed trade and political relationships with\nEuropean countries, using these alliances to contain both the Ottomans and the Portuguese in Southwest\nAsia. In a further effort to promote cultural blending, Shah Abbas called in Chinese artisans to contribute their\nexpertise to the design of architectural structures in Isfahan. Organized largely along the lines of the Ottoman\nempire, the Safavids expanded their territory to include the Caucasus area and much of Mesopotamia.\nKAPLAN)\n\n186 World History Review\nTHE MUGHAL EMPIRE\nAfter Shah Abbas assassinated or incapacitated his most promising sons, the Safavid empire was left in the\nhands of weak rulers who fell to the armies of Afghanistan in 1722. To the east, however, another Islamic empire\nhad risen, this time in northern India. After the fall of the Gupta empire, India had been invaded by both Arabs\nand Muslims from central Asia, who had divided the subcontinent into a number of tiny kingdoms under the\ncontrol of rulers called Rajputs, or Rajahs.\nThe Muslim invasion of India was especially devastating to Hindus. Around the year 1000, Turkish armies moved\ninto India, destroying cities and Hindu temples. The weakened subcontinent was brought into some degree of\norganization when Delhi became the capital of a loosely unified Turkish empire called the Delhi Sultanate.\nThe Hindus, however, continued to be oppressed, creating the source of future conflict between Muslims and\nHindus in India.\nThe Rule of Babur\nAfter Tamerlane’s annihilation of Delhi in 1398, Indian unification was not realized until 1526 with the reign of\nBabur, a Turk from central Asia. Claiming that he was descended from both Chingghis Khan and Tamerlane,\nBabur eventually created an army that would conquer India and provide the basis for the Mughal, or “Mongol”\nempire.\nThe Golden Age Under Akbar\nThe golden age of Mughal power would be realized under the rule of Babur’s grandson Akbar (reigned 1556-\n1605). By outfitting his army with heavy artillery, Akbar was able to consolidate his rule of Gujarat and Bengal.\nAkbar, a Muslim, tolerated a variety of religions within his realm and permitted both Hindus and Muslims to\nrise to prominent governmental positions. In a further effort to unite his people, Akbar imposed a system of\ngraduated taxes that were affordable even to poorer subjects.\nAkbar’s policy of blending the cultures of India extended to language usage. Persian served as the language of\nAkbar’s government and of high society. Commoners spoke Hindi, a local language which is still widely spoken\nin India today. A new language called Urdu emerged from the cultural blend of soldiers in the Mughal armies;\na blend of Persian literary forms and Arabic characters, Urdu is the official language of Pakistan today.\nDivision Under Aurangzeb\nThe extent of the Mughal empire reached its height under Aurangzeb (reigned 1658-1707), who widened his\nrule to include the entire subcontinent except for a small area at its southern tip. Aurangzeb also sowed the seeds\nof future discord in his empire by abandoning the tolerant policies of Akbar. By taxing Hindus and destroying their\ntemples and rebuilding them as mosques, he garnered the hatred of the Hindus for generations to come.\nAnother group angered by the policies of Aurangzeb were the Sikhs.

      "reference_material_content": "The Roman and Han Empires 95\ne\nTHE HAN EMPIRE\nWhile the Pax Romana unified the Mediterranean basin, China’s classical civilization, the Han empire, developed\nalong similar lines. The Han empire (206 sce to 220 ce) would prove the longest and most influential of all\nChinese dynasties, prompting the Chinese of future generations to refer to themselves as “People of Han.”\nThe Han Dynasty was preceded by the Qin Dynasty (whose internal improvements would have a bearing on the\nsuccess of the Han Dynasty). The Qin arose after the collapse of the Zhou Dynasty in the third century sce.\nThe Qin were noted for their extensive use of bronze and iron. Their most lasting achievement, however, was the\nconstruction of public works such as canals and roadways. The Chinese had long possessed a line of walls to\nhold back the advances of invaders. Under the Qin, these walls were connected, resulting in the beginning\nstages of the Great Wall, a 1,400-mile structure that protected the Chinese from potential invaders from the\nwest and north.\nUpon coming to power, Liu Bang, the founding Han ruler, immediately instituted a strong centralized government\nthat ensured peace and stability for the Chinese people. Particularly influential was Empress Lii (195-180 ace),\nwho seized and retained control over the throne by naming her infant sons as emperors. The achievements\nof the Qin were expanded by the longest-ruling of the Han rulers, Han Wudi (141-87 sce), who appointed\nprovincial administrators to promote governmental efficiency.\nDuring the Han Dynasty, Chinese emperors used a complex bureaucracy to aid their rule. To pay for this large\nbureaucracy, as well as for the imperial army, the government levied taxes. Chinese peasants paid their taxes by\ngiving the government part of their yearly crop. Merchants also paid taxes. In addition to taxes, peasants also\nwere required to give the government a month's worth of labor or military service every year. Han emperors\nused this source of labor to build roads, dig canals, and create irrigation systems.\nRoads and canals encouraged trade and communication throughout the Han empire. The Silk Roads linked\nChina to the Mediterranean world. Some of the Han people migrated southward into the present-day areas of\nBurma, Laos, and Thailand. Like Rome, the Han empire expanded its borders, expanding into Korea and Vietnam\nand encouraging the assimilation of those areas into Chinese culture. Most Han Chinese were farmers; however,\nthe rapid growth of the iron industry produced fine manufactured goods for trade along the Silk Roads.\nKnowledge of the production of silk spread to most parts of China; silk was a valued commodity in long-distance\ntrade with the West, especially with the Roman Empire.\nFunded by taxes on trade, agriculture, and the work of artisans, the Han Empire boasted an imperial university.\nThe shi, or scholar class, promoted education, while the first civil service examination was instituted under the Han.\nKAPLAN)\n\nThe prosperity of the Han period produced significant population growth as well as technology more advanced\nthan that of any other classical civilization. Among the inventions and advances attributed to the Han are\npaper, the rudder, the compass, porcelain, the seismograph, acoustical studies, and a calendar of 365 days. It\nis possible that the practice of acupuncture originated with the Han.\nThe Decline of the Han\nIn spite of the achievements of the Han period, the empire also saw inequities which, as in the case of Rome,\nprecipitated its decline and eventual fall. Land was distributed unequally between rich and poor. Women were\nkept in a subordinate position, although upper-class women were often educated in writing and the fine\narts. The Hsiung-nu, peoples along the Han borders whom the Chinese considered barbarians, presented an\never-present threat; the Han Chinese paid them tribute to prevent them from invading Chinese territory. The\neconomic strain of efforts to contain the Hsiung-nu and expand the empire further weakened it. Han Wudi\nconfiscated the property of the upper class, a policy which weakened both trade and manufacturing. Peasants\ncontinued to revolt against their plight. A series of poor harvests prompted many small landowners to sell their\nproperty or even themselves into slavery.\nInept rule by the successors of Han Wudi led to the overthrow of the Han dynasty in 6 ce by Wang Mang. The\nStrict control executed by Wang, however, led to peasant rebellion resulting in the overthrow of Wang in 23 ce\nand the restoration of the Han. Still plagued by poor emperors and internal weakness, the later Han were forced\nto contend with repeated invasions of the Hsiung-nu. Epidemic disease significantly reduced the population of\nthe Han empire as it had in Rome. Han generals increasingly seized power as the empire declined. The collapse\nof the Han empire in 220 ce allowed barbarians into the Chinese borders, producing 400 years of political and\neconomic turmoil and the division of the former empire into numerous regional kingdoms.\nTHE SILK ROADS\nAn intelligence mission undertaken by an envoy of Han Wudi led to the opening of the Silk Roads, which\neventually would link western China to the easternmost reaches of the Roman empire. Embracing both land\nand sea routes, the Silk Roads would play a prominent role in world history during two periods, the first from\n150 sce to 900 ce. During this period, the Silk Roads were used by nearby societies who were attracted to the\nwealth and material goods of the classical empires. Trade routes encompassed by the Silk Roads included the\nregions of central Asia, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian Ocean. In the Indian Ocean, an active\nroute linked Ceylon and India with the societies of Southeast Asia. Pastoral nomads from the Steppes of central\nAsia proved key players in the story of the Silk Roads—sometimes by threatening to interfere with trade and\nsometimes by fostering conditions that led to improved trade connections. Travelers and traders could acquire\npack animals and buy protection through tribute payments to nomadic peoples.\nTrade along the Silk Roads promoted the development of regional resources and manufactures offered as trade\nitems. Among the items traded along the Silk Roads were spices, jewels, cosmetics, grain, wine, olivé oil, and\njewelry. The introduction of the stirrup spread both east and west, contributing to the success of the cavalry in\nChina and the horsemanship of the European medieval knight.\nFew people traveled the entire length of the Silk Roads with their merchandise; instead, they relied on middlemen\nto transport their goods part of the distance. Indians and Parthians (from the present-day Persian: Gulf area)\nKAPLAN)\n\nThe Roman and Han Empires 97\nwere particularly active as middlemen along the Silk Roads, as were the Jews, Greeks, and Armenians in the\nMediterranean basin. Malay merchant mariners were noted for their long-distance voyages from the islands of\nsoutheast Asia to both India and East Africa, capitalizing on the seasonal patterns of monsoon winds to facilitate\ntheir journey.\nReligion Along the Silk Roads\nBy the first century sce, Buddhism had traveled the Silk Roads through the travels of merchants, reaching as far\nas China. Oasis towns along the Silk Roads harbored Buddhist monasteries that served as inns for early traders.\nNomadic peoples along the Silk Roads would trade with oasis cities and, in the process, learn of Buddhism. By\nthe fifth century ce, the Chinese had become sufficiently comfortable with the presence of the Buddhist monks,\nnuns, and traders among them to accept the Buddhist faith in a widespread fashion. Both Buddhism and Hinduism\nspread through Indian Ocean trade to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Malay peninsula, Cambodia, and\nVietnam.\nChristianity diffused across the land routes and sea lanes of the Silk Roads through the activity of missionaries.\nBy the third century ce, Christianity had reached central Anatolia, and Christian communities had emerged\nthroughout the Mediterranean basin as far as Spain and Gaul as well as North Africa. Christianity also spread to\nPersia and India, remaining a prominent faith in those areas even after the arrival of Islam in the 600s. By the\nthird century ce, Christian monasteries began to form in the Roman world.\nAnother religion that traveled the Silk Roads was Manichaeism, named after its founder Mani (216-272 ce).\nAppealing to merchants, Manichaeism was a blend of beliefs of other major religions and considered Zoroaster\n(Zarathustra) as the prophet of Persia, Buddha as the prophet of India, and Jesus as the prophet of the\nMediterranean basin. Manichaeism held that life was a struggle between good and evil and that good could be\nachieved by abandoning worldly pleasure. A life after death awaited those who achieved the good in this life in\nan eternity filled with goodness and light. The subject of persecution by the Sasanids of Persia and the Romans,\nManichaeism was transmitted to central Asia, where it was accepted by some of the Turkish nomads.\nEpidemic Disease Along the Silk Roads\nEpidemic disease transmitted along the Silk Roads accounted for sharp population declines in the final days\nof both the Roman and Han empires, with China affected by epidemic disease slightly later than the Roman\nworld. Persia also appears to have suffered from outbreaks of epidemic disease. India, however, apparently was\nspared a major outbreak of epidemic disease. In both China and Rome, Silk Road trade declined as a result of\nthe reduction in population.\nKAPLAN)"

      "reference_material_content": "140 World History Review\nMONGOL SOCIETY\nThe people of Mongolia (located to the northwest of China in central Asia) would dramatically alter the interactions\nand history of Europe and Asia. The Mongols were pastoral nomads organized into families, clans, and tribes. Their\nunique portable tents, or yurts, gave them the flexibility to travel from one location to another. The Mongols were\nexpert warriors who could ride for days, even sleeping and eating in the saddle. In the 13th century, they began\nto migrate from the steppes of central Asia toward better grazing lands to the south and southwest.\nThe leaders of Mongol tribal councils were always men. Women, however, were allowed the right to speak out\nin the tribal councils and also held considerable influence within their own family.\nMONGOL CONQUESTS\nFrom 1206 to 1227, under the leadership of the formidable Temujin (who took the name Chinggis Khan, or\n“Universal Ruler”), the Mongols conquered vast portions of Asia. One of the great military strategists in world\nhistory, Chinggis Khan organized his military force into units independent of family ties. After breaking up tribes\nand forming new military units, Chinggis Khan chose talented leaders to take charge of his men. To show his\npower, he constructed a palace at Karakorum in Mongolia. Adopting Chinese siege warfare technology, he\nemployed devices such as the catapult and gunpowder technology to further his conquests of other societies.\nThrough his knowledge of steppe diplomacy, Chinggis Khan served to link Europe and Asia. After his death\nin 1227, his successors continued to acquire territory from China to Poland, creating the largest land empire in\nhistory. For easier administration, the empire was divided into four regional empires: China, central Asia, Persia,\nand Russia (the Khanate of the Golden Horde). Each Khanate was ruled by a descendant of Chinggis Khan.\nThe Mongols in Persia\nSweeping into Persia in 1231, the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants, interrupted\ntrade, and destroyed cities, some of which never recovered. In 1258, Islamic civilization was dealt a crippling\nblow when Mongols defeated the Abbasids in Baghdad. Throughout Southwest Asia, the invaders destroyed\nancient qanat irrigation systems. Eventually, the Mongols allowed the Persians to rule their local territory as\nlong as they paid tribute and maintained law and order. Mongols retained the highest governmental positions.\nGradually, the Mongols in Persia assimilated to the local culture and often adopted Islam as their religion.\nThe Mongols in Russia and Central Europe\nThe Khanate of the Golden Horde demanded tribute from the Russians. The Mongol invasion of Russia in 1237\nwas the only time in history that a winter invasion of Russia succeeded. Mongol rule created a long-standing\nmistrust between Russia and Westerners by keeping Russia isolated from the lifestyle and technology of the\nWestern world. The lack of Mongol concern with promoting cultural interests kept Russian areas such as Moscow\nculturally impoverished, isolating them from the cultural and economic wealth of the European Renaissance.\nInept administration maintained Russia’s economic backwardness. During Mongol rule, Russian peasants became\nserfs of the Russian ruling class in exchange for their protection.\nMoscow finally rose to prominence when Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod cooperated with the Mongols.\nActing as a tribute collector for the Mongols after 1328, Nevsky's government annexed those territories that did\nKAPLAN)\n\nThe Mongols and Eurasian Interactions 141\nnot pay tribute, adding to the territory and power of Moscow. Granted the title of Grand Prince, Nevsky became\nthe first of a line of princes who became leaders of Moscow and eventually all of Russia. In 1480, Ivan Ill of\nMoscow stopped paying taxes to the Mongol leader, effectively ending the Mongol presence in Russia. The\nMongols continued to rule the Crimea until the end of the 18th century.\nEven central Europe was not exempt from Mongol advances. In 1241 and 1242, the Mongols centered on the\nareas of present-day Poland, Hungary, and eastern Germany, reaching the outskirts of Vienna before they were\nfinally turned back.\nThe Mongols in China\nThe grand prize of the Mongol invaders was their occupation of China, where they set up a tribute empire\nbeginning in 1270. Under the leadership of Kublai Khan, the grandson of Chinggis Khan and founder of the\nYuan dynasty, the Mongol capital was moved to the site of present-day Beijing, solidifying the tradition of,\na centralized government in China. Kublai Khan also extended the length of the Grand Canal to connect the\nHuang He River with Beijing in order to haul food supplies, especially rice, into Beijing. He ended the Confucian\nsystem of education and reliance on civil service examinations. Although he promoted Buddhism, Kublai Khan\nsupported the right of Daoists, Muslims, and Christians to exercise their faith.\nDistrustful of the Chinese, the Mongols brought foreign merchants and administrators into China and largely\nremained separate from the Chinese. They outlawed marriage between Mongols and Chinese and forbade the\nChinese from studying the Mongol written language. Mongol women refused to engage in the Chinese custom\nof foot-binding. They also retained their property rights, enjoyed more freedom to move about publicly, and had\nconsiderable control over their household.\nIn addition to its presence in China, the Yuan dynasty advanced into Vietnam, briefly occupying Hanoi but\nfailing to conquer the country. Incursions into Cambodia, Burma, and Java proved unsuccessful, largely because\nthe Mongols did not adapt well to the hot, humid climate of those areas. Attempts to conquer Indonesia and\nJapan also failed. Twice, in 1274 and 1281, massive Mongol forces were turned back from a successful invasion\nof the Japanese islands by a mighty wind the Japanese called kamikaze. The aborted invasion of 1281 was the\nlargest seaborne invasion prior to World War Il. The Yuan dynasty did occupy Korea from 1231 to 1350, requiring\nKoreans to pay tribute to the khan. The Mongol domination of China ended in 1368 when the Chinese defeated\nthem and established the Ming dynasty.\nTHE MONGOL PEACE\nThe Mongol presence in Eurasia led to a period of peace and prosperity for the continent. The so-called Mongol\nPeace, which endured from the 1250s to the 1350s, ensured the safety of travelers along trade routes in\nEurasia and resulted in increased trade volume between Asia and Europe, most notably along the Silk Roads.\nThe Mongols established foreign embassies and maintained diplomatic relations with Korea, Vietnam, India, and\nwestern Europe. The Mongols also resettled people in new lands and recruited craftsmen to better the lifestyle\nof those they ruled.\nKAPLAN)\n\n142 World History Review\nThe Black Death |\nIncreased trade was a contributing factor to the spread of the bubonic plague, or the Black Death, as Europeans\ncalled the disease. The plague had been unknowingly brought into China by Mongol invaders, whose food sacks\nhad been invaded by infected rats and fleas. Appearing initially in southwestern China in the 1330s, the bubonic\nplague first spread throughout China and central Asia. By the late 1340s, it had spread throughout Southwestern\nAsia and then into Europe and northern Africa. Mongol invaders catapulted plague-infested bodies over the\ncity walls of the Black Sea port of Kaffa in 1346, further transmitting the epidemic. Following the path of the\ntrade routes, the disease spread from city to town, wiping out nearly half the population in areas it infected.\nMerchants in the Mediterranean compounded the problem by carrying plague from port to port.\nBy 1351, the plague had almost run its course in Europe. Approximately one-third of the European population\nhad died, resulting in massive shortages of labor. Workers were demanding high wages, and when some\nauthorities froze wages, rebellions broke out. The prestige of the Church declined as Europeans questioned its\ninability to halt the progress of the epidemic among them. Some areas of China reported losses of up to two-\nthirds of their population. The ravages of the plague exacted a 100-year recovery period in Europe and China.\nIn Egypt, the Middle East, and other areas of the Islamic empire, recovery took even longer. Population levels in\nEgypt failed to recover completely until the 19th century.\nTHE FALL OF THE MONGOL EMPIRE\nPoor administration and economic distress brought down the Mongol empire. In Persia, the Mongols’ excessive\nspending caused them to print relatively valueless paper money. The resulting inflation caused merchants to close\ntheir shops. When the Mongol rule in Persia ended in 1335, the Persian government returned to local rule until\nthe Turks reinstated centralized government in the late 14th century.\nIn China, the people rebelled against the valueless paper money. The devastation brought by the bubonic plague\nfurther weakened the Mongol rule. The desire of the Chinese to reassert their cultural identity after long years\nof Mongol rule strengthened the ability of the Ming dynasty to return China to the Chinese. Even though they\nwere ousted by the Chinese in 1368, the Mongols remained a constant threat to the northwestern borders of\nChina into the 18th century.\nKAPLAN)"

      "reference_material_content": "Chapter 8: Empires of South Asia\nTIMELINE\n'3 21-185 BCE Mauryan empire\n320-550 cE Gupta empire\nHun incursions into northern India\nIMPORTANT PEOPLE, PLACES, EVENTS, AND CONCEPTS\nChandragupta Maurya stupa* monsoon*\nAshoka sati*\nNote: Terms marked with an asterisk appear in the Glossary.\nTHE MAURYAN EMPIRE\nWhen Alexander the Great and his troops departed India in 325 sce, a local ruler from the prosperous agricultural and\ntrading center of Magadha in the central Ganges plain rose to power. Chandragupta Maurya (322-298 sce) began\na program of conquest that would include northwestern India and areas of the Ganges plain and would form the first\nunified, centralized government in India. Relying on the advice of a treatise called the Arthashastra, Chandragupta\nand his successors amassed an empire that encompassed all of present-day India except for the southern tip.\nThe Mauryans supported their government by taxing agricultural crops. Standard coinage throughout their empire\nfacilitated trade, while government control of manufactures, mines, and shipbuilding strengthened the state. A\nnational army consisted not only of infantry and cavalry divisions, but also of chariots and war elephants.\nThe Rule of Ashoka\nThe greatest of the Mauryan rulers was Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta. One of Ashoka’s greatest joys\nwas conquest—until he witnessed the horrible results of his conquests in eastern India. Rather than continuing\nto devote his energy to conquest, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and embarked on a program to construct\npublic works and to encourage vegetarianism in an effort to reduce the slaughter of animals. His policy of ending\nKAPLAN) 101\n\nthe killing of cows, combined with the already revered status of cattle from the Aryan era, contributed to the\nconcept of sacred cows that became a part of the Indian civilization. Ashoka also attempted to live his Buddhist\nfaith by spreading peace and building an efficient government. His efforts met with resistance from the caste\nof brahmins, whose power was displaced by Ashoka’s central government.\nThe Buddhist disapproval of the caste system was advantageous for artisans and merchants, who supported the\ngrowing number of Buddhist monasteries. Buddhist law also improved the status of women by granting them\nmore authority within their families and by allowing them to enter the monasteries as Buddhist nuns.\nAshoka publicized his tolerant Buddhist program by engraving his decisions on large rocks and sandstone pillars\nthat he had scattered throughout his empire. Great shrines of stone, called stupas, were constructed by the\nBuddhists to house relics of the Buddha. Ashoka also furthered the Buddhist faith by sending missionaries\nto Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Himalayan regions, and the grasslands of central Asia. By means of the Silk Roads,\nBuddhism spread to various points of southeast and east Asia.\nThe End of the Mauryan Empire\nAfter Ashoka’s death in 232 sce, weaker rulers ascended to the Mauryan throne. By 185 sce, the empire no\nlonger existed, and political division characterized the South Asian subcontinent. Waves of invaders entered the\nregion, until the rise of a new dynasty that would allow the brahmans to diminish the power of Buddhism and\nstrengthen the position of Hinduism in India.\nTHE DECLINE OF BUDDHISM IN INDIA\nThe decline of Buddhist power in India was, in part, caused by the actions of the Buddhist monks themselves.\nThe monks had become more preoccupied with philosophy than with serving the needs of the common people\nin India. As the monks devoted more time to the wealthy patrons who supported the monasteries, the brahmans\nused this opportunity to capture the attention of the ordinary people of India. The new focus of Hinduism called\nupon followers to become personally involved in the worship of the major gods Shiva and Vishnu. More temples\narose to house statues of the gods, and even untouchables were allowed to embrace the new form of Hinduism,\nwhich eventually allowed the inclusion of the Buddha as one of the many Hindu gods. Women were also permitted\nto participate. The Upanishads acquired new prominence as Hinduism taught that the ultimate purpose of the soul\nwas to merge with the divine essence from which it had originated. The world itself was viewed as an illusion.\nAfter the fall of the Han empire in the third century ce, trade decreased, creating a decline in merchant support for\nthe Buddhist monasteries. Furthermore, the arrival of a new dynasty sympathetic to Hinduism hastened the decline\nof Buddhism in India. The center of Buddhism would now shift to central and southeast Asia and to China, Japan,\nand Korea; there Buddhism would develop into the Mahayana form, which allowed rituals in worship.\nTHE GUPTA EMPIRE\nLike the Mauryan empire, the Gupta empire was founded by a family from the kingdom of Magadha in eastern India.\nBy the conclusion of the fourth century ce, the Gupta family had amassed an empire that included most of northern\nIndia, though not as extensive as that of the Maurya family. Although the Gupta empire was not as centralized as\nits predecessor, it succeeded in bringing nearly 300 peaceful and prosperous years to the people of northern India.\nKAPLAN)\n\nEmpires of South Asia 103\nWomen in Gupta Society\nCharacteristic of the Gupta rule was a further definition of Hinduism and the caste system. Restrictions upon\nmembers of the lowest castes and the untouchables became even more severe. The position of women also\ndeclined under the Guptas. Under Hindu law, women were minors subject first to their father, then to their\nhusband, and then to their sons. Women were not allowed to own or inherit property. Marriages were usually\narranged, and young girls often left home years before their marriage to live with and be molded by their\nfuture mother-in-law and future husband. Female infants were often viewed as economic liabilities and were\nfrequently killed. Women who were widowed before they bore sons were ostracized from society; widows with\nsons were not permitted to remarry. The most pronounced degradation of women involved the custom of sati.\nThis practice, which was observed in some parts of India among the elite varna, or castes, expected a widow\nto throw herself on her husband’s burning funeral pyre. Women who failed to honor their deceased husbands\nin this manner were forbidden to remarry and were excluded from society.\nGupta Achievements\nWhile denying educational opportunities to women and members of lower castes, the Gupta empire was noted\nfor an array of achievements, especially in mathematics and science. Gupta mathematicians accurately calculated\nthe value of pi to four decimal places and the circumference of the earth. They also used decimals and developed\nthe concept of the zero as a placeholder. Another achievement was the introduction of the numbers used\naround the globe (the Western world would label these “Arabic” numbers because they came to the West via\nArab traders and academics). Gupta physicians set up hospitals and developed treatments for numerous diseases\nand various surgical techniques. .\nThe Gupta period was also renowned for its artistic and literary achievements. The poet Kalidasa, who was\nconsidered the greatest writer in the Sanskrit language, painted word pictures of Gupta life. Also noteworthy\nwere the rock paintings and statues of the Buddha located in the caves of Ajanta; the caves also housed\nmonasteries for Buddhist monks.\nIn spite of the decline in long-distance trade with China, commerce flourished between Gupta India and other\nareas. Archeological finds of Roman coins in southern India attest to the presence of trade between these two\nareas. One remaining trade route included passage through the Hindu Kush to Persia and the Mediterranean\nworld. Mariners used the monsoon winds to cross the Indian Ocean to Southeast Asia and the islands of\nIndonesia, and they also sailed to Arabia. The overland route between India and China still saw some trade,\ndespite the presence of bandits.\nDecline of the Gupta Empire\nSimilar to the experiences of the Han and Roman empires, the Gupta empire was plagued by repeated attacks\nof foreigners along its border areas. The Xiong-nu, or Hunas, who exerted pressure on the borders of the Han\nempire also raided across the Himalayas into northern India during the early fifth century ce. The drain on the\ntreasury resulting from efforts to repel Hunas invaders, combined with internal struggles between Gupta rulers\nand their vassals, led to the eventual collapse of the Gupta empire. By 530 ce, the empire was overrun by further\nXiong-nu invasions and broke up into numerous local governments.\nKAPLAN)"

      "reference_material_content": "SAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nTRANSPORT WITHIN THE BODY—\nTHE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\nThe circulatory system is designed to move stuff around the body. It transports oxygen, carbon\ndioxide, glucose, hormones, waste products, lipids, etc. Essentially, the circulatory system\nconsists of a pump (the heart), a network of tubing (the blood vessels), and a fluid (the blood).\nLet’s start by talking about the blood.\nTHE BLOOD\nAny organism with a closed circulatory system has blood. A closed circulatory system just means\nthat the blood is carried in vessels. But some organisms do not have a closed system; their blood\n(called hemolymph in these organisms) is not carried in vessels; it simply bathes the organs in\ntheir body cavities. Examples of organisms with open circulatory systems are the arthropods\n(insects, crustaceans etc.).\nBlood consists of two main things: (1) fluid and (2) cells that float around in the fluid. The\nfluid is called plasma, and the cells that float around are red blood cells, white blood cells, and\nplatelets.\nPlasma is mostly water. It has a lot of stuff dissolved in it, such as glucose, hormones, ions, and\ngases. The glucose makes it sticky. It also has a lot of protein in it, like albumin (the most abun-\ndant protein in blood), fibrinogen, and lipoproteins. All the blood proteins are made by the\nliver, and plasma makes up about 50% of the blood volume.\nMost of the cells in the plasma are red blood cells. In fact, red blood cells make up about 45%\nof the total blood volume. Red blood cells are shaped like biconcave disks, which look sort of\nlike disks that have been squashed in the center, on both sides. Red blood cells are filled with\na protein called hemoglobin. There is so much hemoglobin in red blood cells that there is no\nroom for organelles or a nucleus. Red blood cells are the only cells in the body that do not have\na nucleus.\nHemoglobin can bind oxygen. Because red blood cells contain hemoglobin, and hemoglobin\ncarries oxygen, we say that red blood cells carry oxygen and deliver it to cells all over the body.\nReally, though, it’s the hemoglobin that carries the oxygen.\nHemoglobin is made partly of iron. That means that if you don’t get enough iron in your diet,\nyou can't produce enough hemoglobin. Your red blood cells can’t bind enough oxygen, and\nyour body’s cells get shortchanged.

      "reference_material_content": "SAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nEvolution and Species\nSuppose two individuals—such as a bumblebee and a dog—have such different genes that\ntheir gametes can’t meet and form a new individual. We say the two individuals belong to two\ndifferent species. When we say “different species,” we mean individuals that can’t produce\nviable offspring together.\nThink again about our frogs, separated by an earthquake. Imagine that, over time (hundreds of\nthousands of years, perhaps), the frogs in Place 1 undergo so many changes to their gene pool\nthat they wouldn’t be able to mate with the frogs in Place 2, even if they were brought together\nagain. The frogs in Place 1 and the frogs in Place 2 would be considered separate species. We\nwould say then that evolution caused speciation.\nSpeciation is simply the formation of a new species, by evolution.\nAnother way to describe what happened to the frogs is to say they underwent divergent evolu-\ntion. Divergent evolution is the process by which two populations of the same species end\nup having different behaviors and traits. They used to have similar traits, but as a result of a\nchanging environment, they changed, and over time, their behaviors and traits were no longer\nsimilar; in other words, they diverged. In the case of the frogs, the pressure to change came\nfrom the fact that the different environments had different types of predators.\nIf the evolution of the populations continues, and after a very long time the populations can no\nlonger mate and produce offspring (which is what happened to our frogs), then the two popula-\ntions are now two separate species—speciation occurred. So speciation is just the extreme form\nof divergent evolution.\nSometimes, similarities in structure among species give evidence of their evolutionary history.\nOne example is in the forelimbs of all mammals: these all consist of the same skeletal parts.\nObviously, the function of a whale’s flipper is very different from that of a bat’s wing. But these\nhave similar structures, despite their differing functions. Homologous structures are common\nin species that share a common ancestor.\nWhat If Two Populations Become More Similarto One Another?\nConsider a population of rodents and a population of insects that inhabit the same environ-\nment. Suppose that in this particular environment there are many ground-dwelling predators.\nIf the rodents and the insects could somehow get off the ground, they would be safe from the\npredators. Suppose further that through mutation and genetic variability, and over a long period\nof time, the insects developed a set of modified legs that could expand to act as glider wings,\nso that whenever a large gust of wind came around the insects would become airborne. This\nwould keep them off the ground and away from the predators. More of them would survive,\nand, gradually, the majority of this population of insects would have this “flying” ability.\nWhat about the rodents? What if, also through mutation and genetic variability, over this same\nlong period of time, they developed extensive skin folds between their front and back legs that\nallowed them to remain airborne when leaping from tree to tree?\n194 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nClearly the two populations—the insects and the rodents—could never mate and produce\noffspring. But they have become more similar to each other in terms of behaviors and traits.\nBoth populations developed specialized structures that allowed them to “fly.” In other words,\ntheir traits and behaviors converged. Evolution that results in the production of similar traits\nand behaviors between two separate populations and/or species is called convergent evolution.\nSomething to remember about convergent evolution is that it NEVER results in speciation (the\nformation of two separate species). Furthermore, it can NEVER bring two completely different\nspecies into a single species.\nIt is important to recognize that not all similar structures are inherited from a common\nancestor, or homologous. In the example above, the insects and rodents both have wings.\nHowever, these are not homologous structures, they are analogous. Analogous structures are\nsimilar adaptations that result from convergent evolution.\nHomologous vs. Analogous Structures\nIn summary, here are some of the key differences between these two structures.\nAnes\nThe following illustrations also help to show commonalities and distinctions between these\ntwo types of structures.\nFin\nShark\n(fish) <ow onl QB\\\nWing\n: WA\nvi, A > SN\nFlipper\nDolphin\nAnalogous Structures\n9. Evolution and Diversity | 195\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nHomologous Structures\nOne Last Thing to Remember\nAs a population evolves because of pressures from its environment, sometimes structures that were\nimportant at one time become unimportant as the environment, the population, and the popula-\ntion’s behaviors change. ‘These useless structures become smaller and smaller and eventually are not\nseen in the organisms except as remnants of their former selves. These remnants are called vestigial\nstructures. Examples of vestigial structures are the appendix in humans and leg bones in snakes.\n‘Correct answers can be found in Part IV.\n196 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com"

If you're a cat and your fur is gray,\nthen we say that, in terms of fur color, your phenotype is gray. If your fur is white, then we\nsay, in terms of fur color, your phenotype is white. If we meet a person who has diabetes, we\nsay that, in terms of diabetes, his phenotype is diabetic. If we meet another person who does\nnot have diabetes, we say that in terms of diabetes, her phenotype is nondiabetic, or we might\nsay that her phenotype is normal. So phenotype just refers to the actual traits that an organism\ndoes and does not possess.\nPHENOTYPE AND GENES\nAs you'll remember, we said that, generally speaking, chromosomes are arranged in homolo-\ngous pairs. Each member of the pair is similar to, but also different from, the other member.\nLet’s look at one pair of chromosomes, and, in particular, let’s focus on one part of each chro-\nmosome. We want to make the picture easy to look at, so we won't bother with actually shaping\nthe chromosomes like a double helix/twisted ladder.\nBlack fur Black fur\nNotice that each of these shaded portions is labeled “black fur.” This means that the particular\npart of the chromosome that we've decided to look at codes for fur color.\nNow, this particular pair of chromosomes codes for enzymes that give\nWhen we say phenotype, we're\nrise to black fur.

The genotype is the description of which versions\n160 | For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nof a gene an organism has on its chromosomes. For the organism that we're now talking about—\nthe one with the black fur—we'd (1) look at the homologous chromosome pair pictured above,\n(2) see that both homologous chromosomes show a gene for black fur, and (3) say\nFur Color Genotype: black/black (or BB)\nFur Color Phenotype: black\nMore About Genotype and Phenotype: Features That Are\nDominant and Recessive\nLet’s consider another organism with black fur. When it comes to fur, what’s the organ-\nism’s phenotype? It’s black.\nNow let’s look at its genotype. Here are the chromosomes that contain the genes responsible for\nfur color.\nBlack fur White fur\nNotice, then, that in this example there are two “versions” of the gene for fur color—a black fur\nversion and a white fur version. When the two copies of a gene are different versions, it is called\nheterozygous. If the versions are the same it is called homozygous. Versions of a gene are called\nalleles, and we can refer to the black fur allele or the white fur allele.\nThe two homologous chromosomes don’t agree on what color the organism’s fur should be.\nOne codes for black fur, and the other codes for white fur. Yet one member of the pair defi-\nnitely wins the debate, since the organism has black fur. When we want to describe this organ-\nism’s phenotype and genotype in terms of fur color we say\nGenotype: black/white (or Bb)\nPhenotype: black\nWhy does one of the chromosomes get to express itself in the organism’s phenotype while the other\none has to keep quiet? Here’s the answer: for the species to which this organism belongs, black fur\nis dominant, and white fur is recessive. That just means that if an organism of this species has one\nblack-fur chromosome and one white-fur chromosome, the organism will have fur that’s black. A\ndominant allele will always give rise to the phenotype. A recessive allele only gives rise to the pheno-\ntype when there are no dominant alleles to overshadow it.\n8.Genetics | 161\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nNotice that we can use a sort of “shorthand” to indicate genotype. We can use letters to represent\nthe alleles an organism has. For example, in our first organism, the one in which both chromosomes\ncode for black fur, we described the genotype as black/black, or BB. The uppercase B represents the\nallele for black fur because black is dominant. In our second organism, in which one chromosome\ncodes for black fur and one codes for white fur, we described the genotype as black/white, or Bb.\nThe lowercase b represents the allele for white fur.\nUppercase letters are used to represent domin. ant alleles, and lower‘c ase\nletters are used to represent recessive alleles.\nNotice also that the letter chosen to represent the dominant allele is the same letter chosen to\nrepresent the recessive allele. In other words, we didn’t switch letters and represent the allele\nfor white fur with a lowercase w. As long as we're talking about the same trait (in this case, fur\ncolor), the letter stays the same; we just use uppercase for dominant and lower case for recessive.\nLet’s consider a few more organisms of this species. Here’s one with fur color genotype: white/\nwhite.\nWhite fur White fur\nIts fur-color phenotype will be white. Even though white is recessive, both chromosomes agree\nthat the fur should be white. There’s no black-fur chromosome around to dominate the matter.\nAs a matter of fact, if you see an organism of this species and its fur is white, you know that\nits genotype is white/white, or bb. Because white is recessive, that’s the only genotype that can\nproduce a white phenotype. If a black-fur chromosome were around, the phenotype would have\nto be black. A white-fur phenotype definitely means a bb genotype because white is recessive.\nCodominance and Incomplete Dominance\nIt is possible, in the case of multiple alleles (i.e., more than two), for two alleles to exhibit codom-\ninance. This means that a heterozygote expresses both alleles. This is the case, for example, when\nsomeone has the blood type AB. Their blood cells have both types of proteins on them at the\nsame time instead of just having protein A or protein B. Neither is dominant.\nAnother special type of dominance is incomplete dominance. In this type, the dominant and\nrecessive alleles blend together and the phenotype is sort of an in-between version of them. An\nexample would be if a heterozygote has a red allele and a white allele and the flower phenotype\nturns out pink.\n162 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com"

Herbivores get energy by eating plants, and\ncarnivores by eating herbivores or other carnivores. The foundation of all ecosystems\nand the source of the energy in these ecosystems and on planet earth as a whole is\nphotosynthesis. Plants are autotrophs, or self-feeders, that generate their own chemical\nenergy from the energy of the sun through photosynthesis. There are also many\nprokaryotic photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that\ncontribute significantly to global productivity. The chemical energy that plants get from\nthe sun is used to produce glucose that can be burned in mitochondria to make ATP,\nwhich is then used to drive all of the energy-requiring processes in the plant, including\nthe production of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

One by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen; this\nmakes photosynthesis of keen interest to all of us air-breathers since it is the source of\nthe oxygen that we need to survive. Photosythesis has two main parts, the light reaction\nand the Calvin cycle. The light reaction occurs in the interior of the thylakoid, while the\nCalvin cycie occurs in the stroma. Plants are green because they reflect green light the\nmost. The pigments involved in photosynthesis absorb the most strongly in the red and\nblue wavelengths.\nLight Reactions\nThe first part of photosynthesis is made up of light reactions, in which light energy is\nused to generate ATP, oxygen, and the reducing molecule NADPH. The molecule that\ncaptures light energy to start photosynthesis is a pigment called chlorophyll found within\nthe thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. Chlorophyll is used by two complex systems\nKAPLAN)\n\n86 Biology Review\ncalled Photosystem | and Photosystem // in the thylakoid membrane. When photons strike\nchlorophyll, electrons are excited and transferred through the photosystems to a reaction\ncenter. The light reactions, which can collectively be called photophosphorylation, are\ngrouped into two types of reactions using two photosystems: cyclic and noncyclic\nphotophosphorylation.\nCyclic reactions are conducted by Photosystem | and contribute to ATP production but do\nnot produce NADPH.

Protons flow down this chloroplast proton\ngradient back out into the stroma through an ATP synthase to produce ATP.

Population\n6. Community\n7. Ecosystem\n8. Biome\n,\n9. Biosphere\nWe've already discussed many of these levels of biological organization (cells, tissues, organs,\nand organisms) in previous chapters. Let’s begin with the fifth level—population.\nWHAT IS A POPULATION?\nWe've mentioned the term population before, but we never really defined it, so let’s do that now.\nA population is a group of individuals in a particular area that interbreed\nand therefore share the same gene pool.\nA population is sort of a subset of a species. Think about it this way: a species is a group of\norganisms that is ab/e to interbreed, and a population is a group of organisms that és inter-\nbreeding. For example, a group of mice on the West Coast of the United States may belong to\nthe same species as a group of mice on the East Coast of the United States because if they were\nbrought together, they could interbreed. However, because they are separated by such a great\ndistance, they are NOT interbreeding and are NOT members of the same population.\nBecause a population consists of a group of organisms that are interbreeding, this is the level ig\norganization at which evolution is seen.\n332 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nEvolution does not act on an individual; individuals cannot evolve. But\npopulations can evolve, as their individuals (and more important, their\nindividuals’ offspring) undergo changes in phenotype and genotype.\nPopulation Growth\nThere are two types of population growth you should be familiar with for the test. The first is\nexponential growth, and the second is limited growth. The two types are related; a popula-\ntion that starts off growing exponentially will ultimately reach a level at which it is unable to\nsustain that rapid rate of growth, at which point growth becomes limited.\nConsider a single bacterium. This bacterium can divide by binary fission to produce two\nbacteria. It takes the bacterium about 20 minutes to accomplish this, if all the conditions for\ngrowth are ideal. After another 20 minutes, both of the new bacteria would undergo binary\nfission, and we'd have four bacteria. After another 20 minutes, we'd have 8, then 16, and so on,\nand so on, and so on. After just one day—24 hours—we’d have more than 4 x 107! bacteria.\nThat’s 4,000 billion billion bacteria!\nIn this type of growth the size of the population increases exponentially, and if we graphed it,\nit would look like this:\n@Nofue mi nbdeirvi duals\nTime —\nOf course, in reality this could never happen. As the bacterial population continued to grow,\nnutrients would get used up, space would become scarce, and waste products would accumu-\nlate. Some members of the population would die, and the growth curve would flatten out as\nthe population stabilized.\n16. Ecology | 333\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nCarrying capacity\nPeriod of .\neNofue mi nbdeirvi duals\nexponential growth\nTime —\nHere, the maximum population size is limited. The maximum population size that a particular\nenvironment can sustain is referred to as the carrying capacity.\nThe carrying capacity of an environment can change if the environment changes. For example,\nif we provide our bacterial population with a larger container and more food, the carrying\ncapacity would increase to reflect this.\nSuppose we had a field of grasses that could support a population of 100 mice. Suppose further\nthat a drought reduced the number of grasses that could grow. The field may no longer be able\nto support all 100 mice. In this case, the carrying capacity of the field would decrease.\nWHAT IS A COMMUNITY?\nA community is a group of populations that live in a particular environment. These popula-\ntions can interact with one another in many different ways, including symbiotically, compet-\nitively, and predatorily, but not reproductively. We already talked about symbiosis in Chapter\n15, so we won't cover that again. Instead, let’s talk about competition and predation.\nBattling It Out\nTechnically, we've also already mentioned competition, when we talked about evolution in\nChapter 9. We said that organisms that were more successful competitors would be better able\nto survive within their environment. What do we mean when we say “competitors”?\nTo understand competition fully, we have to introduce a new term: the niche. An organism’s\nniche is the way it lives in its environment, including its nesting behavior, what type of food\nit eats, and when it hunts. You can think of it like this: if an organism’s environment is its\naddress, then its niche is its job.\nIf two populations have similar niches (for example, if they hunt the same food at the same\ntime), there will be a lot of competition between the two populations. The two populations\nbecome competitors against each other for the food. Usually, one population will “win out”\n334 For more free content, visit PrincetonReview.com\n\nSAT Subject Test Biology E/M Prep\nover the other (it will compete more effectively), and that population will grow in size (to\nits natural carrying capacity), while the other population will shrink. In extreme cases, the\nwinning population will compete so effectively that it will drive the losing population out alto-\ngether. This allows the winning population to be the sole occupant of the niche.\nThen What?\nWell, we know from Chapter 9 that competition drives evolution. So\nwhat happens next is that the populations evolve. Generally, the winning\nPopulations and Evolution: A\npopulation doesn’t have to evolve too much, because the members of\nQuick Summary\nthe population can keep on doing what they’ve been doing—they’re\n¢ Populations occupy\nnow the sole owners of the niche. But the losing population has to find\ndifferent niches within their\nanother way to survive. Obviously, trying to occupy the original niche\nenvironment.\nwas a failure. Perhaps some members of the losing population might\nbegin hunting at a different time. This would allow them to be more If two populations have\nsuccessful because the winning group is temporarily out of the picture. similar niches, they will\nOver time, this would produce differences in the populations’ hunting compete for sole “ownership”\ntimes, and they would occupy different niches., of the niche.

The organism the niche, and the losing\npopulation must evolve to\ndoing the eating is the predator, and the organism being eaten is the\nsurvive.\nprey. Usually this results in the death of the prey (in the case of a hawk\neating a mouse, for example), but it doesn’t have to (in the case of a Evolution results in populations ©\ngiraffe eating the leaves from the top of a tree—the tree itself usually\nthat occupy different niches,\ndoes not die). thereby reducing competition\nand promoting a more stable\nMany times predation causes the prey to evolve. The prey evolves to\ncommunity.\nbetter escape the predator. Plants evolve to have thorns, mice evolve to\nhave brown fur for better camouflage. In these cases, the evolution of the\nprey causes the predator to evolve—to better capture the prey. Herbi-\nvores evolve tougher mouth skin, hawks evolve to have better eyesight. The alternate evolution\nof two species based on their interactions with each other is called coevolution.\nPredators can affect the carrying capacity of an environment. In other words, an environment\nwithout predators will havea higher carrying capacity than an environment with predators.\nA great example of this is the introduction of a species of perch into a lake in east Africa. The\nintent was to supply the locals living in that area with an additional source of income and food.\nAt the time of introduction, the lake was filled with cichlids, a type of fish that feeds on plants,\nand fishing was abundant. The only problem (and it was a big one) was that the perch were\nnatural predators of the cichlids. Because prior to this there were no predators, the cichlids had\nnot evolved any defenses against them. The introduced perch completely destroyed the cichlid\npopulation, to the point that their own food supply was limited and their population decreased\nin numbers. In fact, the perch population declined so much that there were not enough perch\n(or cichlids, for that matter) to support the local fishing industry.\n16. Ecology | 335"

These particles are known as nucleons. The electrons are shown outside the nucleus.\nThe number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines the atomic number, symbol-\nized Z. All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons and therefore the\nsame atomic number; atoms of different elements have different atomic numbers. Thus, the\natomic number identifies the element. An English scientist, Henry Moseley, first determined\nthe atomic numbers of the elements through the use of X-rays.\nThe sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus is called\nthe mass number, symbolized by the letter A. A particular atom with a specific number of\nprotons and neutrons is called a nuclide. One way to describe a nuclide is by the element\nname followed by a dash and the mass number, i.e., element-A. A beryllium atom with 4\nneutrons is called beryllium-8 because a beryllium atom has to have 4 protons associated\nwith it. The number of neutrons associated with a nuclide can be calculated by subtracting,\nA — Z. Consequently, a neutral atom of beryllium-9 has 5 neutrons because any beryllium\natom has to have 4 protons (or a Z value of 4). A beryllium-9 atom also contains 4 electrons.\nIn any given neutral atom, the number of negative electrons must equal the number of\npositive protons to have a balance of charge. Another way to represent a nuclide is by the\nelemental symbol with a left superscript showing the mass number and left subscript showing\nthe atomic number, generically 4X. Therefore beryllium-9 could also be written as ?Be.\nIsotopes have\nAs aresult of having a different number of neutrons, different nuclides of the same element, the same atomic\n‘called isotopes, have different masses.

The isotopes of a particular\nelement all have the same number of protons and electrons but different numbers of neu-\ntrons. In all three isotopes of hydrogen, the positive charge of the single proton is balanced\nby the negative charge of the single electron. Most elements are found naturally as a mixtures\nof isotopes, some stable and others radioactive. Tin, for example, has ten stable isotopes, the\nmost of any element. :\nThe percentage of each isotope for a naturally occurring element on Earth is nearly always\nthe same, no matter where the element is found.

For example, naturally occurring copper consists of\n69.17% copper-63, which has an atomic mass of 62.919598 amu, and 30.83% copper-65,\nwhich has an atomic mass of 64.927793 amu. The average atomic mass of copper can be\ncalculated by multiplying the atomic mass of each isotope by its relative abundance (expressed\nin decimal form) and adding the results:\n(0.6917 x 62.919598 amu) + (0.3083 x 64.927793 amu) = 63.55 amu\nTherefore, the calculated average atomic mass of naturally occurring copper is 63.55 amu.\nAverage atomic masses of the elements are, more often than not, listed under the symbol for\nthe element in a Periodic Table as a decimal number. These atomic masses are typically\nrounded to one decimal place when doing chemical calculations. The whole number, usually\n- above the elemental symbol, is the atomic number, Z.

      "reference_material_content": "THERMODYNAMICS\nEntropy\nOne of the most important things to remember about thermodynamics is that\nlow-energy states are more stable than high-energy states. That’s such a\nfundamental principle that we’ll ask you to repeat it. Fill in the blank lines:\n__________ energy states are more stable than__________ energy states.\nFundamentally, the universe prefers low-energy states, and also fundamentally, it\ntends toward disorder. When we talk about disorder, we use the term entropy,\nwhich is symbolized by S. Everything tends toward maximum entropy. When we\ntalk about a chemical reaction and the difference between entropy of the\nproducts and entropy of the reactants, we use the symbol (cid:2103)S. If (cid:2103)S is negative,\nthe reaction has lost entropy; the products are more “orderly” than the reactants.\nIf (cid:2103)S is positive, the reaction has gained entropy; the products are less “orderly”\nthan the reactants.\nThe State of Things\nEntropy is a measure of randomness, or disorder. To get an idea of\nwhat this means, consider the two boxes below. Which one has greater\nentropy, or disorder? It’s the one on the right.\n\n\n\nthey’ll ask you to figure out (cid:2103)H for the whole reaction.\nf\nThat’s simple to do; you just add up the heats of formation for all of the products\nand then all of the reactants, multiplying each by its coefficient from the\nbalanced equation, and you’ve got (cid:2103)H for the reaction. Remember: (cid:2103)H\nf f\n(reaction) = (cid:2103)H (products) – (cid:2103)H (reactants) and the heats of formation of all\nf f\nelements are zero. Look at this reaction:\nC H O (s) + 6O (g) (cid:2097) 6CO (g) + 6H O(l)\n6 12 6 2 (cid:1995) 2 2\nSuppose you’re told that the heat of formation for\n• C H O (s) is (cid:2106)1,273 kJ/mol\n6 12 6\n• H O(l) is (cid:2106)286 kJ/mol\n2\n• CO (g) is (cid:2106)393 kJ/mol\n2\n((cid:2103)H for O (g), of course, is 0.)\nf 2\n(cid:2103)H for the whole reaction is equal to\nf\n(cid:2103)H(products) – (cid:2103)H(reactants)\nf f\nSo\n(cid:2103)H(products) = 6 mol((cid:2106)393 kJ/mol) + 6 mol((cid:2106)286 kJ/mol)\nf\n= (cid:2106)(cid:2001)4,074 kJ\n(cid:2103)H (reactants) = (cid:2106)1,273 kJ + 0 kJ = (cid:2106)1,273 kJ\nf\nSo, (cid:2103)H for the whole reaction = ((cid:2106) 4,074) – ((cid:2106)1,273) = (cid:2106)2,801 kJ. (cid:2103)H for the\nwhole reaction is negative, which means the reaction is exothermic.\nThis principle also applies to reactions that occur in more than one step. Hess’s\nlaw says that if a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, (cid:2103)H for the reaction\nwill be equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps. Overall,\n(cid:2103)H is independent of the number of steps or the pathway the reaction follows."

Each of these represents a specific number of\nitems and is not dependent on the commodity. A dozen eggs, oranges, or bananas will always\nrepresent 12 items. In chemistry we have a unit that decribes a quantity of particles. It is called\nthe mole (sometimes abbreviated as mol). A mole is 6.02 x 102° particles. Technically, that’s\nthe number of carbon atoms found in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. Since the atomic masses\n“of all the elements’ atoms are related to the mass of carbon-12, a mole is also the number of Just as a dozen\natoms found in the atomic mass of any element if it is expressed in grams. Keep in mind that is 12 units of an\nitem, a mole is\nthe masses found on the Periodic Table for any element are actually weighted averages of all 6.02 x 1023 units\nthe isotopes that exist for that element (based on their relative natural abundances). Those of an item. It is\ncalled\nmasses, if expressed in atomic mass units (amu), represent just one average atom for that\nAvogadro’s\nelement. If, however, the value for mass was expressed in grams, that sample of the element number.\nSTOICHIOMETRY (CHEMICAL CALCULATIONS) AND THE MOLE CONCEPT 171\n\nwould contain 6.02 x 10%3 atoms of that element. This value is also known as Avogadro's\nnumber in honor of the Italian scientist whose hypothesis concerning the volumes of gases\nKnow Avogadro’s\nnumber and its led to its determination. More on Avogadro's hypothesis will be discussed in an upcoming\nuse, section on gas volumes and molar mass. You should recognize that Avogadro's number is very\nlarge because the items being counted (atoms) are very small. So 6.02 x 10*° atoms of most\nelements represent samples of atoms that are conveniently sized for working in the\nlaboratory.\nMOLAR MASS AND MOLES F\nThe mass of a mole of particles is referred to as its molar mass. For moles of atoms, the atomic\nmass found on the Periodic Table for that element expressed in grams is the molar mass for\nthat element. Some elements naturally exist as molecules, however. The molar mass of those\nelements takes into account the number of atoms in the molecule in an additive manner.\nMost elements are considered in a monatomic way (one atom). However, a few (hydrogen,\nnitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are typically considered in a\ndiatomic manner (two atoms) based on the way they are generally found to exist. This is not\nto say that you could not count moles of hydrogen atoms (H) as opposed to hydrogen mol-\necules (H,). You should, though, always be cognizant of the type of particle involved in any\nmole calculation.\n=> Example 1\nDetermine the molar.mass of silicon, nitrogen, and iron using the Periodic Table.\nThe atomic mass of silicon is 28.1 amu as found on the Periodic Table. Therefore, the molar\nmass of silicon is 28.1 g and represents 6.02 x 103 atoms of silicon or 1 mole of silicon atoms.\nThe atomic mass of nitrogen is 14.0 amu as found on the Periodic Table. Nitrogen (N,) is\na diatomic element, however. It has a molar mass of 28.0 g, which represents 6.02 x 1023\nmolecules of nitrogen or 1 mole of nitrogen molecules. A mole of nitrogen (N) atoms would\nhave a mass of 14.0 g if they were the appropriate particle to be considered in a given\ncircumstance.\nThe atomic mass of iron is 55.8 amu. So iron has a molar mass of 55.8 g. This represents a\nsample of 6.02 x 10*3 atoms of iron or 1 mole of iron atoms. Iron is typically not found in\nnature as a diatomic molecule.\nElements are just one type of substance for which the molar mass can be found. The molar\nmasses of compounds can be found in a way similar to that of diatomic elements. Just add\nup the molar masses of the individual elements found in the compound based on the com-\npound’s formula.\n=> Example 2\nFind the molar mass of N H, (this is a molecular compound known as ammonia).\nThe molar mass of nitrogen is 14.0 g, and the molar mass of hydrogen is 1.0 g. Since there\nare 3 hydrogen atoms per molecule of ammonia, the molar mass of ammonia is 17.0 g and\nrepresents 6.02 x 1023 molecules of ammonia or 1 mole of ammonia molecules.\n172 SAT SUBJECT TEST IN CHEMISTRY\n\n=> Example 3\nFind the molar’mass of CaCO, (this is an ionic compound known as calcium carbonate).\nThe molar masses of calcium, carbon, and oxygen are 40.1 g, 12.0 g, and 16.0 g, respectively.\nSince there are 3 oxygen particles per formula unit of calcium carbonate in addition to the single\nparticles of calcium and carbon, the molar mass of calcium carbonate is 40.1 g + 12.0 g +\n(3)16.0 g or 100.1 g. This represents 6.02 x 1073 formula units (the particle for an ionic com-\npound) or 1 mole of calcium carbonate.\n=> Example 4\nFind the molar mass of CuSO, : 5 H,O (this is a hydrated ionic compound known as copper(II)\nsulfate pentahydrate).\nThe molar masses of copper, sulfur, oxygen, and water are 63.5 g, 32.1 g, 16.0 g, and 18.0 g,\nrespectively. Since there are 4 oxygen particles and 5 water molecules per formula unit in\naddition to the single particles of copper and sulfur, the molar mass of copper(II) sulfate\n- pentahydrate is 63.5 g + 32.1 g + (4)16.0 g + (5)18.0 g or 249.6 g. This represents 6.02 x 103\nformula units or 1 mole of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate.\nMOLAR MASS AND GAS VOLUMES\nIn 1811, Amedeo Avogadro made a far-reaching scientific assumption that also bears his\nname. Avogadro’s Hypothesis states that equal volumes of different gases contain equal\nnumbers of particles at the same temperature and pressure. It means that under the same\nconditions, the number of molecules of hydrogen in a 1-liter container is exactly the same as\nthe number of molecules of carbon dioxide (or of any other gas) in a 1-liter container even\nthough the individual molecules of the different gases have different masses and sizes.\nBecause of the substantiation of this hypothesis by much data since its inception, it is\noften referred to as Avogadro’s Law and can be added to the list of gas laws discussed in\nChapter 5. Avogadro's Law shows the relationship between the volume and the number of\nparticles of a gas sample when the temperature and pressure are constant:\n=ui e\n3(S\nIn other words, volume and the number of gas particles are directly related.\nBecause the volume of a gas may vary depending on the temperature and pressure, a\nstandard is set for comparing gases. As stated in Chapter 5, the standard conditions of tem-\nperature and pressure (abbreviated STP) are 273 K and 1 atmosphere. Because the relation-\nship between volume and number of particles of a gas is direct when the temperature and\npressure are constant, the molar mass of a gas (which represents a set number of particles,\nnamely 1 mole) occupies a setvolume. The volume of 22.4 Lis recognized as the molar volume\nof any gas at STP.\nUSING MOLAR MASS AND MOLAR VOLUME\nMolar mass and molar volume are typically used as conversion factors to change quantities\nof reactants expressed as masses or as volumes to moles for use in stoichiometry problems\nvia dimensional analysis.\nSTOICHIOMETRY (CHEMICAL CALCULATIONS) AND THE MOLE CONCEPT 173\n\n= Example 1\nFind the number of moles of silicon present in 4.30 g of silicon.\nRecall that silicon is an element that is not diatomic. It has a molar mass of 28.1 g. So 28.1 g\nof silicon contains 1.00 mol of silicon atoms if significant figures are kept in mind.\nUse dimensional analysis:\n4.30¢Si 1.00 mol Si\n1 x 28.1 Si = 0.0153 mol Si\nNote that when using dimensional analysis, the given quantity is simply multiplied by a\nfactor that is equal to the value 1 since the numerator and denominator in that factor are\nequal to each other. Using this method causes the magnitude of the given quantity not to\nchange. What does change is the unit in which the quantity is expressed. The given units\ncancel out, leaving only the unit in the numerator of the factor to describe the quantity.\n=> Example 2\nFind the number of moles of calcium carbonate in 0.750 g of calcium carbonate.\nRecall that calcium carbonate is an ionic compound. It has a molar mass of 100.1 g. So\n100.1 g of calcium carbonate contains 1.00 mol of calcium carbonate.\nUse dimensional analysis:\n0.750 g CaCO3 $ 1.00 mol CaCO; = 0.00749 mol CaCO;\n1 100.1 g CaCO3\n=> Example 3\nFind the number of moles of ammonia in 0.300 L of ammonia at STP.\nRecall that ammonia is a gas at STP. Since the given quantity is supplied as a volume and\nnot as mass, molar volume (not molar mass) should be used in the dimensional analysis\nequation:\n0.300 L NH3 , 1.00 mol NH,\n= 0.0134 mol NH3\nI 22.4L NHg\n174 SAT SUBJECT TEST IN CHEMISTRY"

      "reference_material_content": "150 Chemistry Review\nSOLUBILITY AND CONCENTRATION UNITS\nThe solubility of a substance is the maximum amount of that substance that can be\ndissolved in a particular solvent at a particular temperature. When this maximum amount\nof solute has been added, the solution is said to be saturated. In this state, the solution\nis in a state of dynamic equilibrium: The two opposite processes of dissolution and\nprecipitation (or crystallization) are taking place at the same rate.\nIf more solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve. For example, at 18°C,\na maximum of 83 g of glucose (C,H,,O,) will dissolve in 100 mL of H,O. Thus, we can\nsay that the solubility of glucose is 83 g/100 mL. If more glucose is added, it will remain\nin solid form, precipitating to the bottom of the container. In some unique temperature\nconditions more solid can be dissolved than is allowed, in which case the solution is\nsaid to be supersaturated. This is, however, an unstable system, and often the slightest\ndisturbance would cause the excess solute to precipitate out.\nA solution in which the proportion of solute to solvent is small is said to be dilute, and\none in which the proportion is large is said to be concentrated. Of course, very often\nwe need to specify the amount of solute dissolved in a solvent more exactly, and this\nis expressed by the quantity of concentration. Solubility, then, can be thought of as the\nmaximum possible concentration for the given solute-solvent pair in question. In the\nexample above, we mentioned that the maximum concentration of glucose in water\nat 18°C is 83 g/100 mL. More commonly, however, the concentration of a solution is\nexpressed as percent composition by mass, parts per million, mole fraction, molarity,\nmolality, or normality.\nKAPLAN)\n\nSolution Chemistry 151\nPercent Composition by Mass\nThe percent composition by mass of a solution is the mass of the solute divided by the\nmass of the solution (solute plus solvent), multiplied by 100.\nExample: What is the percent composition by mass of a salt water solution if\n200 g of the solution contains 0.3 mol of NaCl?\nSolution: First we need to convert the amount of NaCl into mass:\n0.3 mol NaCl = 0.3 mol x (atomic mass of Na* + atomic mass of Cl)\n= 0.3 mol x (23 + 35.5) g/mol\n= 17.6 g NaCl\npercent by mass = (17.6 g/200 g) x 100% = 8.8%\nKAPLAN)\n\n,\n152 Chemistry Review\nMole Fraction\nThe mole fraction (X) of a compound is equal to the number of moles of the compound\ndivided by the total number of moles of all species within the system. The sum of the\nmole fractions in a system will always equal 1.\nExample: If 92 g of glycerol is mixed with 90 g of water, what will be the\nmole fractions of the two components? (MW of H,O = 18, MW of\nC,H,O, = 92)\nSolution: 90 g water = 90 g x (1 mol/18 g) = 5 mol\n92 g glycerol = 92 g x (1 mol/92 g) = 1 mol\ntotal number of moles = 5+1=6\nX= 5 mol/6 mol= 0.833\nwater\nX jycero = 1 mol/6 mol = 0.167\nglycerol\nSince these are the only two components in the system, one can verify\nthat the two mole fractions add up to be 1.\nMolarity\nThe molarity (M) of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. Solution\nconcentrations are usually expressed in terms of and in units of mol/L, also abbreviated M\nmolarity. Molarity depends on the volume of the solution, not on the volume of solvent\nused to prepare the solution. In other words, mixing 1 mol of solute with 1 L of solvent will\nnot in general give a 1 M solution since the final volume after mixing may be different from\n1 L. You may recall from your laboratory experience that in order to produce a solution\nof a particular molarity, you add solvent to a container (volumetric flask) that already has\nthe solute weighed out in it, until the total volume of the mixture reaches a specific value\n(marked by a ring around the narrow neck of the flask). One generally is not interested in,\nand does not keep track of, the volume of solvent actually added.\nExample: If enough water is added to 11 g of CaCl, to make 100 mL of solution,\nwhat is the molarity of the solution?\n-\nSolution: 11 g CaCl, = 0.10 mol CaCl,\n100 mL = 0.10 L\nDON’T MIX THESE\n. molarity = 0.10 mol/0.10 L = 1.0M\nUP ON TEST DAY\n| Do not confuse molarity and\nMolality\n| molality!\nMolarity = moles of solute/ The molality (m) of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.\nvolume of solution For dilute aqueous solutioris at 25°C the molality is approximately equal to the molarity,\nbecause the density of water at this temperature is 1 kilogram per liter and the volume of the\nMolality = moles of solute/\nsolution is presumed to be approximately the same as that of the solvent (i.e., water) added.\nmass of solvent\nBut note that this is an approximation and true only for dilute aqueous solutions.\nKAPLAN)\n\nSolution Chemistry 153\nExample: If 10 g of NaOH are dissolved in 500 g of water, what is the molality\nof the solution?\nSolution: 10 g NaOH = 0.25 mol NaOH\n500 g = 0.5 kg\n. molality = 0.25 mol solute/0.5 kg solvent = 0.50 m\nDILUTION\nA solution is diluted when solvent is added to a solution of high concentration to\nproduce a solution of lower concentration. The concentration of a solution after dilution\ncan be conveniently determined using the equation below:\nMV, = M,V,\nwhere M is molarity, V is volume, and the subscripts / and fr efer to initial and final\nvalues, respectively. Note that the product MV gives the number of moles of solute, and\nthe equation is just a statement on the conservation of matter: The amount of solute\ndissolved in the solution remains constant after a dilution.\nExample: How many mL of water must be added to 65 mL of a 5.5 M solution\nof NaOH in order to prepare a 1.2 M NaOH solution?\nSolution: The first step is to find the final volume of the solution:\n5.x50 .M065 L=12MxV,\nOe 5.5 X 0.065/1.2 = 0.3 L = 300 mL\nThe volume of water that needs to be added is therefore\n(300 — 65) mL = 235 mL\nKAPLAN)"

      "reference_material_content": "CHEMICAL REACTIONS—HOW MOLECULES\nARE FORMED, BROKEN DOWN, AND\nREFORMED\nIn the course of a chemical reaction, the bonds that hold together the atoms that\nmake up the reactants break. The free atoms then form new bonds with one\nanother to form new molecules—the products of the reaction. Take a look at the\nchemical reaction below:\nC H (g) + 5O (g) → 4H O(l) + 3CO (g)\n3 8 2 2 2\nWhat does this equation tell us? Well, two things. On a molecular level, this\nequation says that 1 molecule of propane (C H ) and 5 molecules of oxygen\n3 8\nreact to form 4 molecules of water and 3 molecules of carbon dioxide. It also\ntells us that 1 mole of C H reacts with 5 moles of O to form 4 moles of H O\n3 8 2 2\nand 3 moles of CO . This equation also indicates the state of each reactant and\n2\nproduct: (s) means solid, (l) means liquid, and (g) means gas.\nNote that when a substance is dissolved in water to create a solution, it is in the\naqueous phase, represented with (aq). This is not the same thing as the liquid\nphase. If you were to take table salt (NaCl (s)) and heat it until it melted, it\nwould become NaCl (l). However, if you took that table salt and dissolved it into\na glass of water, it would create NaCl (aq). Much of chemistry is solution-based,\nand frequently compounds will be dissolved in water to form aqueous solutions\nbefore any reactions take place.\nChemical Equations Must Be Balanced\nLook again at the chemical equation we just presented:\nC H (g) + 5O (g) → 4H O(l) + 3CO (g)\n3 8 2 2 2\nThis is a balanced equation. How can you tell? For each element on the left side\nof the equation, multiply the molecular coefficient by the element’s subscript.\n(Any number that doesn’t appear is assumed to be 1.) For oxygen, in 5O , there\n2\n\nare 5 × 2 = 10 oxygen atoms. Now do the same for the right side of the equation.\nIn 4H O, there are 4 × 1 = 4 oxygen atoms. In 3CO , there are 3 × 2 = 6 oxygen\n2 2\natoms. So there are 4 + 6 = 10 oxygen atoms on the right side, and since there\nare also 10 oxygen atoms on the left side, oxygen is balanced. Now check to see\nthat carbon and hydrogen are also balanced. They are. There are 3 carbons on the\nleft and 3 carbons on the right. There are 8 hydrogens on the left and 8\nhydrogens on the right. For each element in a balanced equation, the total\nnumber of atoms on the left must equal the total number of atoms on the right.\nBalancing Equation Steps:\n1. First, start with the smallest answer choice, and plug it in\nfront of what you want to solve for.\n2. Next, turn to the other side of the equation and fill in\ncoefficients based on what you started with.\n3. If you can’t find whole number coefficients so all the atoms\non either side of the equation add up, turn to the next smallest\nanswer choice and repeat.\n4. If you can balance the equation, check to make sure there is\nno common factor for all of the coefficients. For example, 4, 6,\nand 10 have a common factor of 2. If there is a common factor,\ndivide the coefficients, and you have your answer. If there isn’t,\nyou already have your answer.\nOn the SAT Chemistry Subject Test, you may see up to five questions that will\nshow you unbalanced equations and ask you to balance them. Here’s what those\nwill look like.\n29. …C H (g) +…O (g) → . . . CO (g) +…H O(l)\n2 4 2 2 2\nWhen the equation above is balanced and all coefficients are\nreduced to lowest whole-number terms, which of the\nfollowing would be the coefficient for CO ?\n2\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n\n(C) 4\n(D) 5\n(E) 6\nFortunately, these questions are easy to answer if you use the “plug-in”\nbalancing strategy. Start with choice A, and put the number 1 in front of CO .\n2\n(Don’t be afraid to write in your test booklet as much as you want. Your test\nbooklet belongs to you, and nobody cares what you write in it; only your answer\nsheet is scored.) By adding a 1 in front of CO , we end up with 1 carbon on the\n2\nright. Yet, we have at least 2 carbons on the left, so we know that 1 is not the\nanswer.\nLet’s try choice B. Put a 2 in front of CO , and see what happens. We have 2\n2\ncarbons on the right and 2 on the left. Good. We have 4 hydrogens on the left, so\nlet’s try putting a 2 in front of the H O. That gives us a total of 6 oxygens on the\n2\nright and 2 on the left. Let’s put a 3 in front of O on the left, so we have a total\n2\nof 6 oxygens on the left.\nNow we have 2 carbons on the right and the left, 4 hydrogens on the right and\nthe left, and 6 oxygens on the right and the left. The equation is balanced, and B\nis correct. So, every time a question asks you to balance an equation, use the\nplugging-in strategy. It can’t fail.\n\nSTOICHIOMETRY\nSometimes SAT Chemistry questions will ask you to determine how much\nproduct is formed or reactant is consumed in the course of a chemical reaction.\nThese are stoichiometry questions. When you begin a stoichiometry problem,\nalways remember to work from a balanced equation. The coefficients in front of\neach species indicate the molar ratio between the species. Consider the reaction\nbetween ammonia gas and oxygen, which yields nitrogen monoxide and water.\n4NH (g) + 5O (g) → 4NO(g) + 6H O(l)\n3 2 2\nThis equation tells us that\n• For every 4 moles of ammonia consumed, 5 moles of oxygen are\nalso consumed.\n• For every 5 moles of oxygen consumed, 6 moles of water are\nproduced.\n• For every 4 moles of ammonia consumed, 4 moles of nitrogen\nmonoxide are produced. In other words, the molar ratio of ammonia\nconsumption to nitrogen monoxide production is 1:1.\nHow do you put these molar ratios to use? Take a look: If 2 moles of ammonia\nare consumed, how many moles of water are produced?\nFrom the balanced equation, we see that for every 4 moles of ammonia that are\nconsumed, 6 moles of water are produced. So the ratio of ammonia to water is\n4:6 or 2:3. So 2 moles of ammonia will react completely to produce 3 moles of\nwater.\nRemember that reactants combine according to their mole ratio. So if we\ncombine two reactants that are not in their correct stoichiometric mole ratio, one\nreactant will be consumed first. When this happens, the excess reactant will\nremain unreacted.\n\nConsider this question: If 34 g of ammonia and 32 g of oxygen are combined,\nhow many grams of nitrogen monoxide will be produced?\nThe formula weight of NH is 17 amu; 1 mole of NH has a mass of 17 g and 2\n3 3\nmoles have a mass of 34 g. This means that we have 2 moles of ammonia. How\nmany moles of oxygen do we have? Since the formula weight of O is 32 amu, 1\n2\nmole of O has a mass of 32 g. So our actual mole ratio of ammonia to oxygen is\n2\n2:1. However, from the balanced equation given earlier in this section, we see\nthat the ratio of ammonia consumption to oxygen consumption is 4:5. In keeping\nwith this stoichiometric ratio, 2 moles of ammonia would react with 2.5 moles of\noxygen—but we have only 1 mole of oxygen. We will run out of oxygen before\nall 2 moles of ammonia have reacted, and so oxygen acts as the limiting\nreagent. Once the limiting reagent has been consumed, the reaction will no\nlonger proceed. So we know that 1 mole of oxygen actually reacts, and since 4\nmoles of nitrogen monoxide are produced for every 5 moles of oxygen that react,\n4/5 mole, or 0.8 mole, of nitrogen monoxide is produced when 1 mole of oxygen\nreacts. Finally, the formula weight of NO is 30 amu, so 1 mole of NO has a mass\nof 30 g. The mass of 0.8 mole of NO is (0.8 mole)(30 g/mole), or 24 g.\nClose, But NO Cigar\nIt’s rare in a laboratory to\nget 100% of the expected\nproduct, as a variety of\nexperimental conditions\ncan cause a loss. The\npercent yield in a reaction\ndescribes the percentage\nof the product that was\nsuccessfully created, which\nis written as . So\nin this example, if only\n20 g of NO were produced,\nthe percent yield would be\n= = 83%."

      "reference_material_content": "AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS OF THE INTERNET\nEach circle in the diagram above represents a computer system that is connected\nto another computer system, forming a computer network. The larger circles\nrepresent systems that have a higher bandwidth capacity measured in bits per\nsecond. The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data\nthat can be sent in a fixed amount of time.\n451\n\nA path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and\nreceiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the\nsender and ends at the receiver. Routing is the process of finding a path from\nsender to receiver.\nIf the path from sender to receiver is broken, the path will be rerouted. This\nfault-tolerant nature of the internet makes connections between computing\ndevices more reliable.\nThe internet connects devices and networks from all over the world. The\ninternet is a physical network of fiber optics, radio transmitters, and cabling.\nDevices and networks that make up the internet are connected and communicate\nusing standardized, open communication protocols. A protocol is an agreed-upon\nset of rules that specify the behavior of a system. These internet protocols,\nincluding those for addresses and names, have evolved to allow for the internet to\nbe scalable. The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in\nsize and scale to meet new demands.\n452\n\nInternet Protocol\nInternet protocol (IP) is responsible for addressing and routing your online\nrequests. For a device to connect to the internet, it is first assigned an internet\nprotocol address. When the internet was founded in the 1960s, the creators did not\npredict the need for billions and billions of IP addresses. Currently, we are\nswitching between the fourth and sixth versions of the internet protocol. The\nfourth version (IPv4) uses 32 bits to store IP addresses. These 32 bits can hold 232\nIP addresses. When multiplied out, 232 is actually 4,294,967,296 unique\naddresses. The newer version, IPv6, uses 128 bits, which can hold 2128 IP\naddresses. This is equivalent to approximately\n34,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 unique addresses.\nSwitching from IPv4 to IPv6 is an increase in the capacity by 2128 − 232 = 296\ntimes.\nThis IP address is not permanently assigned to a user’s device and can change\nat any time.\nTransmission Control Protocol\nTransmission control protocol (TCP) is a protocol that defines how computers\nsend packets of data to each other. Data traveling in the internet is broken down\n453\n\ninto small chunks of data called packets. TCP protocols guide the rules on how\ndata are subdivided into packets before transmission.\nTrailer Data Header:\nEnd of packet Sender’s IP address\nReceiver’s IP address\nPacket #\nUser Datagram Protocol\nUser datagram protocol (UDP) is a protocol that allows computer applications to\nsend messages without checking for missing packets to save on time needed to\nretransmit missing packets. UDP is not as reliable as TCP, which does resend\npackets lost when transmitting.\nFAULT TOLERANCE\nThe internet has been engineered to be fault tolerant. If a system fails, a different\npath can be chosen between the sending computer and the receiving computer.\nRedundancy is the inclusion of extra paths that can mitigate the failure of a\nsystem if other components fail.\nWhen a system can support failures and continue to function, it is called fault\ntolerant. This is important because elements can fail at any time, and fault\n454\n\ntolerance allows users to continue to use the network.\nIn the diagram above, the paths various packets travel from computer D to\ncomputer K will not be the same. Because packets can travel different paths, they\nwill likely arrive at the target computer out of order. The paths packets take are\nphysically guided by routers.\nIf a packet is not received, the TCP protocol will request the sender to resend\nthe missing packet. The IP addresses of both the sender and receiver are found in\nthe header of the packet. When all packets are received, the packets are put\ntogether using the packet numbers found in the header to form the original binary\nmessage.\nThe process from computer D to computer K in the diagram above is called\nend-to-end architecture. This process involves the breaking down and assembling\nof the packets at each end. What happens to the packets in the middle is hidden\nfrom the user in an abstraction.\nDifference Between Internet and World Wide Web\nThe internet refers to the hardware. It is made up of the computers, cables,\nrouters, and many more components that make up the entire network. It is a\nglobal decentralized network connecting millions of computers. The World Wide\nWeb, in contrast, refers to the software used on the internet. HTTP is a protocol\nused by the World Wide Web to transmit data. The internet allows access to the\nWorld Wide Web, which is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.\n455"

      "reference_material_content": "INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM DATA\nPeople generate significant amounts of digital data daily. Some always-on devices\nare collecting geographic location data constantly, while social media sites are\ncollecting premium data based on your usage.\nPeople can use computer programs to process information as well as to gain\ninsight and knowledge. Information is the collection of facts and patterns\nextracted from data.\nGaining insight from this valuable data involves a combination of statistics,\nmathematics, programming, and problem solving. Large data sets may be\nanalyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations. These\ntrends are powerful predictors of future behaviors. Investors are constantly\nreviewing trends in past pricing to influence their future investment decisions.\nHowever, sometimes trends can be misinterpreted and result in business disasters.\n171\n\nDigitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation\nfound in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists.\nAdditional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.\nOften, the size of the data set affects the amount of information that can be\nextracted from it. A single source often does not contain the data needed to draw a\nconclusion. Combining data from variety of sources may be necessary to\nformulate a conclusion.\nDepending on how the data were collected, the information may not be\nuniform. For example, if users entered data into an open field, the way they chose\nto abbreviate, spell, or capitalize something may vary from user to user. Data sets\npose challenges regardless of size, such as:\n■ The need to clean data\n■ Incomplete data\n■ Invalid data\n■ The need to combine data sources\nCleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their\nmeaning. One example is replacing all equivalent abbreviations with the same\nword. This can also be done with various spellings and with different\ncapitalizations.\nData can get too large for traditional data-processing applications. The ability\nto process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools. Social\nmedia activity generates an enormous amount of data. In the absence of a data-\nprocessing application, much of this data will go unexamined. All of the\ninformation in the data is too large to examine by hand in real time. Some data\nsets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel\nsystems. Parallel systems are fully covered in Chapter 5, “Big Idea 4: Computer\nSystems and Networks.”\nProblems of bias are often created by the types and sources of data being\ncollected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data. A large amount\nof data is generated by humans. Algorithms that use this data will reflect this bias.\nDespite the advantages of big data, a large sample size can magnify the bias\nassociated with the data being used. Data can have little value if the sample is not\nrepresentative of the population to which the results will be generalized.\nComputing bias is covered more completely in Chapter 6, “Big Idea 5: Impact of\nComputing.”\n172\n\nPredicting Algorithms\nPredicting algorithms use information collected from big data to influence our\ndaily lives. For example:\n■ A credit card company can use purchasing patterns to identify when to\nextend credit or flag a purchase for possible fraud.\n■ Social media sites can use patterns to target advertising based on viewing\nhabits.\n■ An online store analyzing customers’ past purchases can suggest new\nproducts the customer may be interested in buying.\n■ An entertainment application may recommend an additional movie to\nwatch based on the viewer’s interests.\n■ Algorithms can be used to prevent crimes by identifying crime “hot\nspots.” The police can then step up patrols in those areas.\nVisualization of Data\nUsing appropriate visualizations when presenting digitally processed data can\nhelp one gain insight and knowledge. Although big data is a powerful tool, the\ndata will lose their value if they cannot be presented in a way that can be\ninterpreted. Visualization tools can communicate information about data. Column\ncharts, line graphs, pie charts, bar charts, XY charts, radar charts, histograms, and\nwaterfall charts can make complex data easier to interpret.\nFor example, the graph below plots users versus profit. When looking at the\ntrends from this graph, it looks like a direct relationship exists between the\nnumber of users and profit. The company might want to invest in drawing more\nmembers or spending on advertisers to draw in new members.\n173\n\nGraph of increasing profits\nPredicting trends is not a guarantee of future usage. For example, the above\ngraph cannot predict an innovation that could make this current innovation\nobsolete. It can be dangerous to draw conclusions based on good data and assume\nthat those conclusions apply across the board or that past patterns will remain\nconsistent. Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a\nconclusion (see graph below). It may be necessary to combine data from a variety\nof sources to formulate a conclusion.\n174\n\nGraph of increasing profits with decrease at end of graph.\nPredicting algorithms use historical data to predict future events. This data are\nused to build a mathematical model that encompasses trends. That predictive\nmodel is then used on current data to predict what will happen next.\nExample Twenty-Four\nWhat can be learned from the following data table kept in a pet store?\nAnswers:\n■ The date when a certain dog food was purchased the greatest number of\ntimes\n■ The total number of cities in which a certain food was purchased\n■ The total number of foods purchased in a certain city during a month\nE-commerce sites use data to determine how much inventory to hold and how\nto price products. Additionally, data about product views and purchases power the\nrecommendation engine, which drives a large portion of sales. Data allow for\npersonalized and effective advertisement. Sometimes an e-commerce site knows\nwhat you want to buy before you do.\n175\n\nTargeted advertisers\nExample Twenty-Five\nA high school principal is interested in predicting the number of students passing\na state-level exam. She created a computer model that uses data from third-party\nsoftware showing an increasing student pass rate for the exam. The model\nprovided by the software company predicts a 90% student pass rate. The actual\npercentage of students passing the state exam was 74%. When creating a model,\nall real-world variables cannot be represented. In the case of a model not\naccurately predicting outcomes, addition information can be added to make a\nmore accurate prediction. What are some possible additions to the model to make\nit more reliable in predicting the student pass rate?\nAnswer:\n■ Refine the model to include data from more sources other than the third-\nparty software due to the financial interest in the software being used.\n■ Refine the model to include student data from other schools.\n176\n\n■ Refine the model to include information about the community, such as\nredistricting.\n177"

      "reference_material_content": "HOW PROGRAMS FUNCTION\nA program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task\nwhen run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.\n127\n\nExample of a program\nA code segment refers to a collection of program statements that are part of a\nprogram.\n**On your AP exam, code will be written in both text-based form and\ngraphical-based form. For the following examples, this book will show both\nforms.**\nText-Based Code:\nInput: A list of numbers called myList.\nLine 1: Procedure countEven(myList)\nLine 2: {\nLine 3: count ← 0\nLine 3: FOR EACH item IN myList\nLine 4: {\nLine 5: IF(item MOD 2 = 0)\nLine 6: count ← count + 1\nLine 7: }\nLine 8: RETURN(count)\nLine 9: }\nOutput: A number that indicates how many even numbers are in the list called myList.\nSame Code Written in Graphical-Based Form:\n128\n\nExample of a program written in graphical form\nA program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.\nText-Based Code:\nInput: A list of numbers called myList and a number called val.\nLine 1: Procedure countEven(myList, val)\nLine 2: {\nLine 3: count ← 0\nLine 3: FOR EACH item IN myList\nLine 4: {\nLine 5: IF(item = val)\nLine 6: count ← count + 1\nLine 7: }\nLine 8: RETURN(count)\nLine 9: }\nOutput: A number that indicates how many times val is in the list called myList.\nSame Code Written in Graphical-Based Form:\n129\n\nExample of a program written in graphical form\nIt is difficult to determine if a program works for every condition. Giant\nsoftware companies with hundreds of top coders can test and release a program\nwith confidence to find out only after the release that the program contains hidden\nbugs. For example, the following code will work for any list that starts with 0.\nText-Based Code:\nInput: A list of numbers called myList.\nLine 1: Procedure getTotal(myList)\nLine 2: {\nLine 3: total ← myList[1]\nLine 3: FOR EACH item IN myList\nLine 4: {\nLine 5: total ← total + item\nLine 6: }\nLine 7: RETURN(total)\nLine 8: }\nOutput: The total of all numbers in the list added together.\nSame Code Written in Graphical-Based Form:\n130\n\nExample of a program written in graphical form\nIf myList ← {0,1,5,6} and the procedure getTotal(myList) is called, the\nprocedure will return 12, which is the correct total.\nHowever if myList ← {3,1,5,6} and the procedure getTotal(myList) is called,\nthe procedure will return 18, which is not the correct total.\nTo correct the accumulating problem, the initial value of total must be set to 0,\nnot myList[1].\nText-Based Code:\nInput: A list of numbers called myList.\nLine 1: Procedure getTotal(myList)\nLine 2: {\nLine 3: total ← 0\nLine 3: FOR EACH item IN myList\nLine 4: {\nLine 5: total ← total + item\nLine 6: }\nLine 7: RETURN(total)\nLine 8: }\nOutput: The total of all numbers in the list added together.\nSame Code Written in Graphical-Based Form:\n131\n\nExample of a program written in graphical form\nA programmer can never have too many test cases. Logical errors demonstrate\nwhy collaboration is so important in programming. Sometimes a programmer has\nbeen looking at code for so long that he or she cannot see errors. It is common for\na fresh-eyed programmer to spot errors that an entrenched programmer working\non code for a long time cannot see.\nA complex program can be described broadly by what it does. By keeping the\nprogram abstract, the user can focus on just using the program without knowing\nthe details of the code that makes it work. For example, right now I am typing the\nword “Mississippi” into a program called Microsoft Word. I have no idea how the\ncode works, but I can use the interface. When I spell a word incorrectly like\n“libry,” I get a red wiggle underneath “libry” with the suggestion to spell the word\n“library.” I don’t know how the program knows I wanted to spell “library,” but I\nknow how to use the program. This abstraction allows me to concentrate on\nwriting and not worry about how spell-check works.\nPROGRAM INPUT\nProgram input is data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can\ncome in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. For example, a\ncell phone can convert voice (audio) to text to send a message.\nA weather program on your phone could take input in many forms.\n132\n\nExample of input/output\nThis weather app was triggered by the user saying (audio) “Hey Phone…,”\nwhich would be an example of audio input. This triggering is called an event. The\nevent is the action that supplies input data to a program. Events can be generated\nwhen a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or by any other\ndefined action that affects the flow of execution.\nOn your Create Performance Task, input can be any form. Mobile CSP has\nmany sensors, such as an accelerometer, GPS, temperature, and many more that\ncan be used as inputs.\n133"

      "reference_material_content": "SAFE COMPUTING\nSecurity is needed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\ninformation. Security protects that data from cyber attacks and hacking. Privacy is\nthe right to control data generated by one’s usage of computing innovations and\nrestrict the flow of that data to third parties.\nPrivacy and security are concerns with any interaction on the internet. Once a\ncompany’s security or privacy has been compromised, it takes years, if ever, for\ncustomers to trust that company again. Target, Ashley Madison, AOL, Yahoo, and\nFacebook are examples of large companies that have had their data compromised,\nwith some of those companies never recovering consumers’ trust.\nPersonally, identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual\nthat identifies, links, relates, or describes that person. Examples of PII include the\nfollowing:\n■ Social security number\n■ Age\n■ Race\n■ Phone numbers\n■ Medical information\n■ Financial information\n■ Biometric data\nPII can be analyzed and processed by businesses and shared with other\ncompanies. The information collected has enabled companies to gain insight into\nhow to interact with customers better. PII and other information can be used to\nenhance a user’s online experience. PII can also be used to simplify making\nonline purchases.\nPII has monetary value. The entire business model for some computing\ninnovations is to sell user information to targeted advertisers. As a result,\nconcerns have been raised over how companies handle the sensitive information\nof their consumers.\nInformation placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that\nmay have a harmful impact. For example, an email message may be forwarded,\ntweets can be retweeted, and social media posts can be viewed by potential\nemployers.\n488\n\nOnce information is online, it is difficult to delete. Information posted to\nsocial media services can be used by others. Combining information posted on\nsocial media and other sources can be used to deduce private information about\nyou.\nCyber criminals are creative in their methods for stealing PII data. One such\ndata breach was an app developed to use on Facebook that was a personality quiz.\nThe app was designed to take the information from those who volunteered to give\naccess to their data for the quiz. This quiz generated more data when the quiz was\nshared with friends and family. The data were then sold to the political consulting\nfirm Cambridge Analytica, which used the data for targeted ads during the 2016\npresidential election campaign. Facebook was fined $5 billion by the Federal\nTrade Commission for violating consumers’ privacy rights.\nTechnology enables the collection, use, and exploitation of information about,\nby, and for individuals, groups, and instructions. For example:\n■ Search engines can record and maintain a history of searches made by\nusers.\n■ Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have\nviewed their pages.\n■ Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user’s\nlocation.\nA computing innovation generates metadata that can have the effect of\nreducing the privacy of the user. Metadata can include geolocation, time, date,\nfilename, and so on. This rapid sharing of user data can often have significant\nimpacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.\n489\n\nFor example, user data can be sold to targeted marketing companies.\nMarketers can use large data sets to target audiences who are likely to buy their\nproducts. For example, the author of this text adopted a puppy named Lilygoose.\nSoon after the adoption, the author received an advertisement for puppy products.\nThis advertisement included the dog’s name, breed, and color. (A picture of\nLilygoose is provided above for reference.)\nThe same open standards that fueled the growth of the internet have, at the\nsame time, left users open to malware. Antivirus software and firewalls can help\navoid malware. However, some cyber criminals hide malware in antiviral\nsoftware! Users must always be aware of who they trust.\nAuthentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized\naccess. Examples of authentication measures include passwords and multifactor\nauthentication. A strong password should be easy to remember but difficult for\nsomeone else to guess. A weak password would be something that PII data can\npredict. Combinations of your birthday and your elementary school would be\neasy to guess if cyber criminals have your PII data.\nMultifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a\nuser is granted access only after successfully presenting several pieces of\nevidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the\nfollowing categories:\n■ Knowledge—something the user knows\n■ Possession—something the user has\n■ Inherence—something the user is\n490\n\nMultifactor authentication requires at least two steps to unlock protected\ninformation. Each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain\nunauthorized access.\nDigital certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the\nownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a\ntrust model.\nEncryption\nTo increase security, encryption is used. Encryption uses cryptographic\nalgorithms to encrypt data. Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent\nunauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data.\nSymmetric key encryption uses the same key for both encryption and\ndecryption. The one key is a shared secret and relies on both sides keeping their\nkey secret.\n491\n\nPublic key encryption (also called asymmetric encryption) uses two keys—\none private and one public. Anyone with the public key can encrypt data, and the\npublic key is public. To decrypt, a second key, which is private, is needed.\n492\n\nPhishing\nUnauthorized access can be gained to computers in several ways. One method is\nphishing. Phishing is a technique that directs users to unrelated sites that trick the\nuser into giving personal data. Phishing is a technique used by cyber criminals\nposing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data,\nsuch as PII, banking and credit card details, and passwords. This personal\ninformation can then be used to access sensitive online resources, such as bank\naccounts and emails.\nScammers often update their tactics, so phishing attacks can be hard to\nidentify. A common phishing scam involves a malicious link that is disguised on a\nwebpage or in an email message, directing the user to a site that the user identifies\nas a trusted site. However, the site is not the trusted site but, instead, is a site\ndesigned to just look like the trusted site. The spoofed site prompts users to\ndownload freeware or shareware that contain malware.\nKeylogging\nKeylogging is another method involving unauthorized access to a computer.\nKeylogging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by the\ncomputer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other\nconfidential information. Keylogging monitors and records every password and\ncredit card number the user types and then sends this information to cyber\n493\n\ncriminals who make use of this sensitive data. Some keyloggers are hardware.\nThe physical hardware is installed between the keyboard and the computer.\nSecurity software cannot detect hardware keyloggers.\nRogue Access Point\nData sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One\nway that this can happen is through a rogue access point. A rogue access point is\na wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks."

      "reference_material_content": "COMBINATORICS\nCombinatorics is the branch of mathematics concerned with counting. (Although that may sound fairly\nfar\neasy, the methods of more advanced combinBa.t orics are from trivial.) Here's an example. LetB's, say we're\ntrying to get fromB City A to City C via City If there are two roads between CBit y A and City and three\nroads from City to City C, how many different journeys are there from A to to C? Since there are two\nchoices for the first route, then three possible choices for the second, the total number of journeys is their\nproduct: 2 x 3 6. This illustrates a basic principle:\n=\nIf there are a possible choices for the first decision and b possible choices for the second deci­\n• sion, then the total number of possible ways these two independent decisions can be made is\nthe product ab.\nADDITIONAL TOPICS + 267\n\nIf there's a third independent decision to be made (with, say, choices), then the total number\nc\n• of ways to make all three decisions is the product abc, and so on.\nExample 7.7 Let's say that the personal code for your ATM card consists of six characters, each\nof which can be any letter or numerical digit.\n(a) How many possible personal codes are there?\n(b) Suppose you want your personal ATM code to have no repeated characters;\nnow how many possible codes are there?\nSolution:\n(a) There are twenty-six letters (A through Z) and ten digits (0 through 9), so there are 26 + 1 0 = 36\npossible choices for each character. Since there are six decisions, any of which can use any of the\n36 366•\npossible characters, the total number of ways the six decisions can be made is (By the way,\nthat's over two billion possible codes.)\n36 35\n(b) There are ways to make the first decision, but only for the second (because, to avoid a re­\npeat, you can't use the same choice you made for the first character). Then there are only 34 pos­\nsible choices for the third character, 33 for the fourth, 32 for the fifth, and 31 for the sixth. Thus,\nthe total number of codes that don't have any repeated characters is 36 x 35 x 34 x 33 x 32 x 31.\n(This cuts down the total number of codes by roughly one-third.)\nPERMUTATIONS AND CoMBINATIONS\nLet's say we're given a set of n objects; in how many different ways can we choose k of them? The answer\ndepends on whether the order in which we select the objects makes a difference. For example, in a horse\nrace that involves eight horses, how many win, place, and show possibilities are there? Well, we want to\nsee how many ways we can choose three horses out of eight, but here order makes a difference; if horses\nA, B, and Care the ones that come in first (win), second (place), and third (show), it matters whether the\nfinishing order is A, B, C or, say, B, C, A. On the other hand, if you're playing five-card draw poker, you\n52;\nreceive five cards out of a standard deck of the order in which they're dealt to you makes no differ­\nence. The number of possible poker hands is found by counting the number of ways we can choose five\n52,\ncards out of without regard to order.\nIf the order in which the objects are chosen does make a difference, each complete selection of k ob­\njects from the original n is called a permutation (the variable r is often used in place of k). If the order is\nirrelevant, then each complete selection is called a combination. general, there are always more per­\nIn\nmutations than there are combinations. To see why, let's go back to the example of the horse race. Each\nof the selections\nA,B, C A, C, B B,A, C B, C,A C,A,B and C,B,A\nis a different permutation, but they're all equivalent to a single combination.\nLet's figure out the number of ways we can choose k things from n, with regard to order. For our\nfirst selection, we can choose any of the given n objects; for the second selection, we can choose any of\nthe remaining n - 1 objects; this process continues until, for the kth selection, we can choose any of the\nremaining n- (k- 1) objects. Since these decisions are independent, the total number of permutations of\nthings taken at a time is the product:\nk\nn\nP(n, k) = n(n -1)(n -2) . . . [n- (k- 1)]\n268 + CRACKING THE GRE MATHEMATICS SUBJECT TEST\n\nNow, let's figure out the number of ways we can choose k things from without regard to order. Let's\nn,\nsay we've chosen k objects from a group of with regard to order. That is, assume we have a permuta­\nn,\ntion of\nn\nthings taken kat a time. In how many ways can wBe, permute these k objects? The answer is k!.\nFor example, consider the Be xample of the three horses-A, and C-given above. Let's say we selected\nthem in the order A then then C. Now that we have these three, we can arrange them in 3! 6 differ­\n=\nent orders; these orders are displayed above. Each of these six orders is a different permutation, but they\ncollectively represent just one combination. In general, the number of combinations of things taken\nk\nat a time is equal to the number of permutations of things taken k at a time divided bny k!:\nn\n-1)]\nC( n k)\nP(n, k)\n=\nn(n -l)(n-2) · · · [n -(k\nk! k!\n= --'--- '----'--- ----'- ---= -'-_.:.- .:.\nI\nThis expression for C(n, k) can be written in another way:\nn!\nC(n k)=\n' k!(n-k)!\nIn this form, you should recognize it as the binomial coefficient:\n(n) n!\n-\nk k!(n-k)!\nIt's called the binomial coefficient because it's precisely the coefficient that appears in the binomial\ntheorem:\nExample 7.8 In a horse race consisting of 8 horses, how many different win-place-show (the\ntop three) finishing orders are there?\nSolution: The order in which the horses finish matters here, so we're looking for the number of per­\nmutations of 8 things taken 3 at a time; this number is:\n7\nP(8, 3) 8 6 336\n=\n= • •\nExample 7.9 How many 3-element subsets does a set containing 9 elements have?\nSolution: The order in which the elements are arranged in a subset is irrelevant.

We'll look at some fundamental ideas of logic, set theory, combinatorics, graph theory, algorithms,\nprobability and statistics, point-set topology, real analysis, complex variables, and numerical analysis.\nLOGIC\nIn mathematics, logic refers to sentential calculus (also known as propositional calculus), which is a logical\nand well-defined system based on sentences. A sentence is a well-formed expression within a language\nand a syntax that can be evaluated as true or false using algebraic tools. The sentence \"The ball is red,\"\ncan be evaluated as either true or false, but the sentence \"Red is the best color,\" cannot be.\nThe language of logic includes a set of variables and a set of connectives from which any sentence can\nbe built according to the rules of syntax. On the GRE, capital letters, such as X or Y, are used to represent\nsentences. A list of connectives follows:\n2S7\n\nH\niff or \"if and only if\"\n-,X X\nthe negation of\nXAY\nXand Y\nX vY Xor Y\nx�Y X, Y X Y\nIf then This conditional sentence is false only if is true and\nis false.\nXHY X X\niffY This biconditional sentence says is true iffY is true.\nX are logically equivalent.\nThe two sentences, and Y,\nX, Y, Z,\nFor sentences and the following theorems hold:\n1. -,-,X HX\nDouble Negation:\nX A Y H Y A X X v Y H Y v X\n2.\nCommutativity: and\nXA(YAZ)H(XAY)AZ Xv(YvZ)H(XvY)vZ\n3.

      "reference_material_content": "Gases and Kinetic Theory\nIdeal Gases\nThe Kinetic Theory of Gases\nAmong the different phases of matter, the gaseous phase is the simplest to\nunderstand and to model, since all gases display similar behavior and follow\nsimilar laws regardless of their identity. The atoms or molecules in a gaseous\nsample move rapidly and are far apart. In addition, intermolecular forces\nbetween gas particles tend to be weak; this results in certain characteristic\nphysical properties, such as the ability to expand to fill any volume and to take\non the shape of a container. Furthermore, gases are easily, though not infinitely,\ncompressible.\nThe state of a gaseous sample is generally defined by four variables: pressure\n(P), volume (V), temperature (T), and number of moles (n), though as we shall\nsee, these are not all independent. The pressure of a gas is the force per unit area\nthat the atoms or molecules exert on the walls of the container through\ncollisions. The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is equal to one\nnewton per meter squared. Sometimes gas pressures are expressed in\natmospheres (atm). One atmosphere is equal to 105 Pa, and is approximately\nequal to the pressure the Earth’s atmosphere exerts on us each day. Volume can\nbe expressed in liters (L) or cubic meters (m3), and temperature is measured in\nKelvins (K) for the purpose of the gas laws. Recall that we can find the\ntemperature in K by adding 273 to the temperature in Celsius. Gases are often\ndiscussed in terms of standard temperature and pressure (STP), which refers to\nthe conditions of 273 K (0°C) and 1 atm.\n\nThe state of a gas can be defined by pressure, volume, temperature, and\namount of gas in moles.\n\nIdeal Gases\nWhen examining the behavior of gases under varying conditions of temperature\nand pressure, it is most convenient to treat them as ideal gases. An ideal gas\nrepresents a hypothetical gas whose molecules have no intermolecular forces;\nthat is, they do not interact with each other and occupy no volume. Although\ngases in reality deviate from this idealized behavior, at relatively low pressures\nand high temperatures many gases behave in nearly ideal fashion. Therefore, the\nassumptions used for ideal gases can be applied to real gases with reasonable\naccuracy.\nMost gases can be treated as ideal.\n\nTHE IDEAL GAS LAW\nThe ideal gas law gives the relationship between the pressure, volume, and\ntemperature of a gas before and after some process. It states that the product of\npressure and volume divided by temperature remains constant during any\nprocess:\nThe ideal gas law states that pressure times volume divided by\ntemperature remains constant.\nIf temperature remains constant during a process (isothermic), the equation\nbecomes\nP V = P V (Boyle’s law).\n1 1 2 2\nIf the volume remains constant during a process (isochoric), the equation\nbecomes\n\nIf the pressure remains constant during a process (isobaric), the equation\nbecomes\nExample: Under isothermal conditions, what would be the volume of a 1 liter\nsample of helium gas after its pressure is changed from 12 atm to 4 atm?\nSolution: Isothermal means that the temperature is constant during the process,\nso the ideal gas law becomes\nP V = P V\n1 1 2 2\n(12 atm)(1 L) = (4 atm)V\n2\nV = 3 L.\n2\nExample: If the temperature of 2 liters of gas is isobarically changed from 10°C\nto 293°C, what would be the final volume?\nSolution: Isobarically means that the pressure remains constant during this\nprocess. But before we can apply the ideal gas law, or Charles’s law in this case,\nwe need to convert Celsius degrees to Kelvins:\nT = 10°C + 273 = 283 K and T = 293°C + 273 = 566 K\n1 2\n\nThen,\nQUICK QUIZ\nTrue or False: As the temperature of a gas is doubled, the average speed\nof each molecule is also doubled.\nAnswer:\nFalse. Temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the\nmolecules, and kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed\nof the molecules. Therefore, the temperature is proportional to the square\nof the average speed, not the average speed."

The quantum\nof American money is one cent; the quantum of negative charge is the electron,\nsince as far as we know there is no smaller negative charge that exists by itself.\nThere are several quantities in physics that are quantized, that is, that occur in\nmultiples of some smallest value. Light is one of these quantities.\nA quantum is the smallest possible unit of a physical quantity.\n\nPhotons and the Photoelectric Effect\nIn chapters 15 through 17 , we treated light as a wave. But there are\ncircumstances when light behaves as though it is made up of individual bundles\nof energy, separate from each other but sharing a wavelength, frequency, and\nspeed. The quantum of light is called the photon. In the late 19th century, an\neffect was discovered by Heinrich Hertz that could not be explained by the wave\nmodel of light. He shined ultraviolet light on a piece of zinc metal, and the metal\nbecame positively charged. Although he did not know it at the time, the light\nwas causing the metal to emit electrons. The phenomenon of light causing\nelectrons to be emitted from a metal is called the photoelectric effect. According\nto the theory of light at the time, light was considered a wave, and should not be\nable to “knock” electrons off of a metal surface. At the turn of the 20th century,\nMax Planck showed that light could be treated as tiny bundles of energy called\nphotons, and the energy of a photon was proportional to its frequency. Thus, a\ngraph of photon energy E vs. frequency f looks as follows.\nThe photon is the quantum of light.\n\nThe slope of this line is a constant called Planck’s constant that appears many\ntimes in the study of quantum phenomena. Its symbol is h, and its value happens\nto be 6.63 × 10–34 J s. The equation for the energy of a photon is\nSo the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, but inversely\nproportional to its wavelength.\nThe energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency.\nExample: List the following photons of light from lowest energy to highest\nenergy:\n1. (A) green\n(B) violet\n(C) yellow\nSolution: Listing these photons from lowest to highest energy is the same as\nlisting them from lowest to highest frequency, or, equivalently, from longest to\nshortest wavelength: yellow, green, violet.\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein used Planck’s idea of the photon to explain the\nphotoelectric effect: One photon is absorbed by one electron in the metal\nsurface, giving the electron enough energy to be released from the metal. But not\njust any photon will knock an electron off of a metal surface. The photon must\nfirst have enough energy to “dig” the electron out of the metal, and then have\nsome energy left over to give the electron some kinetic energy to escape\ncompletely.\nThe photoelectric effect results when light shined on a metal releases\nelectrons from the surface of the metal.\nEach metal that can exhibit the photoelectric effect has a minimum energy and\nfrequency called the threshold frequency (f ) that the incoming photon must\no\nmeet to dig the electron out of the metal and must exceed to give it enough\nkinetic energy to escape. For example, the metal sodium has a threshold\nfrequency that corresponds to yellow light. If yellow light is shined on a sodium\nsurface, the yellow photons will be absorbed by electrons in the metal, causing\nthem to be released, but there will be no energy left over for the electrons to\nhave any kinetic energy. If we shine green light on the sodium metal, the\nelectrons will be released and have some energy left over to use as kinetic\nenergy, and the electrons will jump off the metal completely, since green light\nhas a higher frequency and energy than yellow light.\n\nThe threshold frequency of a metal is the minimum frequency of\nincoming light necessary to release an electron from a metal surface.\nExample: In the case of the yellow light and sodium metal described above,\ndescribe what would happen in the following instances:\n1. (A) We shine orange light on the sodium metal.\n(B) We shine very bright red light on the sodium metal.\n(C) We shine blue light on the sodium metal.\n(D) We shine very bright blue light on the metal.\n(E) Sketch a graph of maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron\n(an electron emitted in the photoelectric effect) vs. frequency of\nincident light for this metal.\nSolution:\n1. (A) Since orange light is below the threshold frequency for sodium,\nno emission of electrons will take place.\n(B) The brightness of the light doesn’t matter if the threshold\nfrequency (minimum color) is not met, and red photons have less\nfrequency than the necessary yellow photons, so no emission of\nelectrons will occur.\n(C) Blue light has a higher frequency and energy than yellow, so\nelectrons will be released from the sodium and will have kinetic\nenergy left over to escape the metal.\n(D) We know that blue light will emit electrons from the sodium, and\na brighter blue light means more blue photons. Since one photon\n\ncan be absorbed by one electron, more electrons will be emitted\nby a brighter light that exceeds the threshold frequency. If these\nelectrons are funneled into a circuit, we can use them as current\nin an electrical device.\n(E) The graph of maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron vs.\nfrequency of incident light would look as follows.\nFor light above the threshold frequency, a brighter light means more\nphotons, and thus more electrons released from the metal.\nNote that the electrons have no kinetic energy up to the threshold frequency\n(color), and then their kinetic energy is proportional to the frequency of the\nincoming light.\nAuto-focus cameras use the photoelectric effect to measure light and\nadjust the lens to focus on the subject being photographed."

      "reference_material_content": "The Two Postulates in the Theory of\nSpecial Relativity\nTo understand special relativity, we must accept two postulates:\n1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.\n2. The speed of light is constant in all reference frames, regardless of any\nrelative motion between an observer and the light source.\nThere are two postulates in the theory of special relativity.\nThe first postulate is not difficult to accept. An inertial reference frame is one\nthat is at rest or moving with a constant velocity (constant speed in a straight\nline). If you throw a ball straight up in the air while you are in a car that is at\nrest, it comes back down and lands in your hand again. If your car is moving at a\nconstant velocity and you throw the ball straight up, it still comes back down in\nyour hand, since the car, you, and the ball all have the same horizontal velocity.\nThis can be extended to any physics experiment that you can think of. In other\nwords, there is not one special inertial reference frame that is better than or\ndifferent from any other when it comes to making physical measurements. This\nleads us to the second postulate, which is a little more difficult for us to accept.\n\nAn inertial reference frame is one that has a constant velocity, including\na velocity of zero.\nThe second postulate of special relativity states that everyone in any reference\nframe will measure the same value for the speed of light regardless of how fast\nhe or she is moving relative to the light source. If I am at rest relative to your\nflashlight and you turn it on, I measure the speed of the light as being c = 3 × 108\nm/s, and so do you. But if you remain at rest, and I begin moving at 100 miles\nper hour, Newtonian physics says that we would not agree on the speed of the\nlight beam since I am moving and you are not. However, Einstein’s second\npostulate states that we will both still measure the speed of the light beam as c =\n3 × 108 m/s. Even if I move at half the speed of light (0.5c), the second postulate\nstill holds true; that is, you and I will still agree on the speed of the light beam, c\n= 3 × 108 m/s. This can be difficult for us to accept, since we are used to taking\ninto account the relative motion between reference frames when calculating\nvelocities. This leads us to some interesting effects on length and time.\nThe speed of light is constant for all observers.\nThe basic equation for the speed of an object is\n\nThe speed of light is written no differently. Substituting the speed of light into\nthe equation, we have\nWe’ve seen that all observers must agree on the value of the speed of light c,\nregardless of their frame of reference. This means that all observers must agree\non the ratio of the two, but they do not have to agree on the value of distance or\nthe value of time. In other words, if you remain still while I accelerate away\nfrom you, the closer I get to the speed of light relative to your position, the more\nwe will disagree on measurements of distance and time. And since we disagree\non measurements of distance, we will also disagree on the lengths of objects.\nThis gives rise to the relativistic effects on length and time:\nAn observer who measures the length of an object moving relative to the\nobserver will measure the length of the object as being shorter (contracted) in\nthe direction of motion compared to the measurement of its length when it is at\nrest relative to the observer.\nLength contracts in the direction of motion for a moving object.\nIn other words, a moving object is shorter than when it is at rest. In order to keep\nthe ratio of length to time constant (equal to c), time must also change:\nA moving clock will run more slowly than a clock that is at rest.\n\nThis is called time dilation, and has been verified experimentally many times.\nThis means that the ticks of a moving clock are farther apart than the ticks of a\nclock that is at rest.\nMoving clocks run more slowly than clocks at rest.\nTime is simply the duration between two events, and since any two observers\nmust agree on the speed of light, they may not agree on the length of a moving\nobject or how much time has passed between two events. Relativistic effects\noccur at all speeds, but they only become measurable at speeds above about ten\npercent the speed of light.\nThere is one other relativistic effect we should discuss. In his 1905 paper,\nEinstein suggested that energy and mass are actually different aspects of the\nsame phenomenon. The famous equation that links energy to mass is\nE = mc2.\nThis equation tells us that energy and mass can be converted into one another,\nand that their value is connected by a constant, the speed of light squared. Since\nthe speed of light is a huge number, a little mass can be converted into a lot of\nenergy, as history has witnessed with the release of nuclear binding energy when\nthe nuclei of atoms are split and that energy is released. But not only can mass\nbe converted into energy, energy can be converted into mass.\nMass and energy can be converted into one another.\n\nA moving object has kinetic energy, and experiments have shown that at high\nvelocities, the kinetic energy of a moving object such as a proton begins turning\ninto mass. As a proton approaches a speed near the speed of light, its mass\nbecomes larger and larger, as verified by momentum measurements. This puts an\nultimate speed limit on moving objects, the speed of light. The equations of\nrelativity tell us that if it were possible for an object to achieve a speed equal to\nthe speed of light, it would have zero length, its clock would stop, and it would\nhave infinite mass. Since none of these are possible in our universe as far as we\nknow, achieving the speed of light is impossible.\nMass increases as speed increases.\nOur discussion of special relativity can be summarized as follows:\nAll inertial reference frames are equivalent.\nThe speed of light is constant for all observers.\nAn observer watching a moving object will see its length contract in the\ndirection of motion, its clock slow down, and its mass increase by the\nequation E = mc2.\nExample: Two spaceships pass you at a speed near the speed of light, each\ncontaining a meter stick, a clock, and a 1 kg block. For each of the following\ndiagrams, describe the changes in the length of the meter stick, the ticks of the\nclock, and the mass of the 1 kg block.\n\nSolution: In Figure A, the meter stick is aligned in the direction of motion of the\nship. Thus, you would measure the meter stick as being shorter than one meter.\nYou would also measure the clock as running slower, that is, more time between\nticks, and the mass as larger than one kilogram.\nIn Figure B, you would still measure the clock as running slower and the mass as\nlarger than one kilogram, but since the meter stick is aligned perpendicular to the\nmotion of the ship, you would still measure it as being one meter long, although\na little thinner, since length contraction occurs only in the direction of motion.\nIf an astronaut in the ship Figure A looked at your reference frame as he was\npassing you, he would see your meter stick as being shorter than one meter, your\nclock running slower, and your mass as larger. Since his reference frame is as\ngood as yours in which to make measurements, he should measure the same\neffects in your reference frame as you measured in his. However, if the astronaut\nlooked at the ship in Figure B, he would see that the length, mass, and time on\nthe other ship would be the same as on his. This is because the two ships are\nmoving at the same speed relative to an outside observer and thus are in the\n\nsame frame of reference; additionally, their speed relative to one another would\nbe zero.\nTHINGS TO REMEMBER\nThe two postulates in the theory of special relativity\nThe laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference\nframes.\nThe speed of light is constant in all reference frames,\nregardless of any relative motion between an observer and\nthe light source."

      "reference_material_content": "ELECTRIC FIELDS\nCharged objects are surrounded by a distortion in space known as the electric field, E. The\nelectric field is similar to the gravity field surrounding masses. Like gravity, the electric field is\na vector quantity having both magnitude and direction. The electric field of a charged object\ncreates an electric force, F,,, on other charged objects located in the field, just as the gravity\nfield of a mass creates a force on other objects with mass. ,\nVisual representations and the mathematical equations for electric fields and gravity fields\nare nearly identical. However, charges and their surrounding electric fields vary from mass\nand gravity fields in some unique ways. Gravity fields always point toward the mass respon-\nsible for the field. However, electric fields can point either toward or away from the charge\ndepending on the sign of the charge. While gravity fields cause objects to only attract each\nother, electric fields can cause charged objects to attract or to repel one another. These dif-\nferences make electric fields a little more complicated than gravity fields. The direction of the\nelectric field and its effect on positive and negative charges is extremely important.\nThe SAT Subject Test in Physics involves two common electric-field configurations: uni-\nform electric field between charged plates and the electric field surrounding spherical point\ncharges. Each field type has its own set of equations and unique problem sets.\nUNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELDS\nUniform electric fields exist between two parallel plates containing equal but opposite\ncharges. These fields are considered to be uniform since both the magnitude and the direc-\ntion of the field are the same at all points between the plates.\nVisualizing Uniform Fields\nFigure 10.1 compares a uniform electric field and a uniform gravity field.\nSurface of Earth\nFigure 10.1 Electric field of charged plates (left)\ncompared to gravity field (right)\nWhereas gravity fields always point toward a mass, such as Earth, electric fields are a bit\nmore complicated due to the existence of two types of charge. An electric field points in the\nsame direction as an electric force points when it is acting on a positive charge. To find the\nelectric field at a point in space due to a charge or to a group of charges, imagine a positive\ntest charge at that location. Determine the direction of force on an imaginary test charge\nplaced in that location. This will be the same as the direction of the electric field. This means\nthat electric fields point away from positive charges and toward negative charges. A uniform\nfield is drawn with parallel and equally spaced arrows. Often diagrams on exams consist of\nthe arrows only, and the plates responsible for the electric field are not shown.\n212 SAT PHYSICS\n\nMagnitude of Uniform Electric Fields\nOften the magnitude of the electric field, E, is given in a problem. Unlike the known value for\nthe gravity field of Earth, g = 9.8 m/s?, the electric field is unique to the plates used in each\nproblem. Although the electric-field strength, E, may be given in a problem, you may also be\nrequired to calculate it using the equations that appear in the following sections. The units\nof the electric field are newtons per coulomb (N/C). The units of the gravity field will most\nlikely be reported in meters per second squared (m/s*). However, when analyzed as a field\nrather than as acceleration, the units for the gravity field can be reported as newtons per\nkilogram (N/kg).\nElectric Force in Uniform Electric Fields\nIf a charge, g, such as a proton or an electron, is placed into a uniform electric field, it will\nexperience an electric force, F,. This is very similar to placing a mass, m, into the gravity field\nof Earth. See Figure 10.2.\nSurface of Earth\nFigure 10.2 Force due to uniform fields\nThe magnitude of force can be determined using the following equations:\nElectricity Gravity\nF,=qE Fo =mg\nA force is an interaction between an object and an agent. The charged plates are the agent IF YOU SEE\ncreating an electric field, E. Charge q is the object that experiences a force, F,,. The formula a charge\nfor the magnitude of the electric force is not dependent on whether charge q is positive or in a uniform\nelectric field\nnegative.\nFigure 10.2 clearly shows that the direction of the electric force, F,, is dependent on the\nsign of the charge located in the field. The force acting on a positive charge, such as a proton,\nwill be in the direction of the electric field. However, the electric force acting on a negative\ncharge is opposite the field.\nF-=qE\nThe force on\nKinematics in Uniform Electric Fields a positive\ncharge is in\nThe sum of all forces acting on an object will determine its resulting motion.

Substitute and solve.\nELECTRIC FIELDS 213\n\nOne aspect of electric-force problems seems to vary from other force problems. Some prob-\nlems include the force of gravity, while others ignore it entirely. Why and when is gravity impor-\ntant? Compared with electric force, the force of gravity is incredibly weak. Although the force\nof gravity is present, its effects are often negligible (too small to affect calculations). Electrons,\nprotons, and ions have insignificant mass, and the force of gravity is usually ignored. In order\nfor gravity to matter, the mass of the charged object must be fairly large. As a general rule of\nthumb, if the object is large enough to be seen, then the force of gravity is probably important.\nProblems on exams frequently test the motion of electrons and protons. The direction of\nthe motion depends on the sign of the charge, with like charges moving in opposite direc-\ntions and unlike charges moving toward one another. When electrons are compared with\nprotons, keep these facts in mind:\n» Electrons and protons have the same magnitude of charge.\na When placed into the same electric field, they will both experience the same magnitude\nof electric force but in opposite directions.\nws The electron has less mass, and the same force will cause it to have a greater acceleration\nthan the proton.\nMillikan Oil Drop\nRobert Millikan determined the charge on an electron by suspending negatively\ncharged oil drops in a uniform electric field created by two charged plates as\nshown in the diagram below. Determine the charge of an electron in terms of the\nmass of the oil drop (m), the electric field (E), and the gravity of Earth (g).\nThe oil drop has enough mass to include the force of gravity. In addition, there\nhas to be an upward force countering gravity to keep the oil drop stationary.\nOrient the problem: The electric field points from the positive plate to the\nnegative plate. The electric force on the negative oil drop points upward,\nopposite the electric field. The force of gravity points downward.\nDetermine the type of motion: This is static equilibrium.\nSum the force vectors in the relevant direction: Since the oil drop is stationary, the\nsum of the forces is zero. Simply set the two opposing forces equal to each other.\nE; is Fo\nSubstitute and solve:\ngE = mg\nSolve g in terms of the other variables.\n. mg\nTSE\n214 SAT PHYSICS"
