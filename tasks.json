Is\nthat legal?\nA federal law called the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act\nprohibits debt collectors from:\nMaking false statements or using offensive language.\nTelling you that failure to pay your debt is a crime, or\nthreatening you with jail time.\n\nThreatening to collect the debt from a third party, like your\nfamily or neighbors.\nThreatening to take your homestead or your paycheck.\nCalling you at work, or calling you between 9 pm and 8 am\n(unless you agree).\nCalling you when it has become aware that an attorney\nrepresents you and has that attorney\u2019s contact information.\nYou can also send a \u201ccease-and-desist\u201d letter to the debt\ncollector by certified mail demanding that they stop\nharassing you at your home or work. Keep a copy for your\nrecords. If the debt collector continues to harass you, you\nmay have grounds for a lawsuit.\nHow can I defend myself against a\nlawsuit from a creditor?\nKnow your rights:\nThe creditor must file a lawsuit within 4 years from the date\nof your last minimum payment or promise to pay on the\ndebt. Even if you owe the debt, you can still challenge it if it\u2019s\nover 4 years from your last payment or promise to pay.\nThe creditor must send you a written demand for payment\n(\u201cdemand letter\u201d) at least 30 days before filing a lawsuit\nagainst you.\nIf you don\u2019t owe the debt or the amount is wrong, reply to the\ndemand letter within 30 days. For a form reply, go to What\nshould I do when a debt collector contacts me?\n\nThe collection agency must provide a copy of the creditor\ncontract if you ask for it. If the creditor has sold your debt\nto a collection agency, the agency is required to keep a\ncopy of the contract between you and the original creditor\non file that shows your account number with the original\ncreditor. You have a legal right to ask for a copy of this\ncontract to make the collection agency prove that they\nhave the authority to collect the debt. Often the debt\ncollection agency would rather not go through the trouble\nof locating, copying and sending you a copy of the creditor\ncontract and will simply stop collection efforts against you\nrather than go through these extra steps.\nHow will I know if I\u2019m being sued?\nYou will be served with legal papers by mail or by a\nprocess server. The first page is the \u201ccitation,\u201d which will\nsay: \u201cYou have been sued\u2026\u201d Read the documents to\nidentify who is suing you and how much they claim you\nowe. File a written answer before the deadline (answer\ndate). If you don\u2019t file an answer or file it too late, the\ncreditor wins by default .\nWhat is an Answer?\nAn Answer is your first response to the lawsuit. Your\nanswer can be a handwritten letter to the court that says\nyou do not agree with the lawsuit. Include your case\n(cause) number and mailing address and any defenses\nyou may have to the lawsuit; for example, the amount they\n\nclaim you owe is incorrect, the account isn\u2019t yours, or the\ndebt is older than 4 years.\nWhen is my answer date?\nThe citation will state when you must file an answer. In\nTexas county and district courts, the answer is due on the\nMonday following 20 days from when you\u2019re served; in\nJustice Court, the answer is due 14 days from when you\u2019re\nserved.\nDiscovery Requests\nThe creditor may have included \u201cdiscovery requests\u201d in\nthe form of Requests for Admissions, Interrogatories, or a\nRequest for Production asking you for documents. You\nhave 50 days to comply with these requests. If you do not\nanswer the Request for Admissions, you will automatically\nlose the lawsuit.\nAn attorney is not required for you to answer the lawsuit or\nsend discovery, but it\u2019s a good idea to contact a lawyer if\nyou have defenses or claims against the creditor.\nWhat if I ignore the lawsuit?\nThe creditor wins by default, and can get a court judgment\nagainst you for the amount you owe and try to collect on\nthe judgment by seizing your property. By law, your\n\nhomestead and certain kinds of property and income are\nexempt. If everything you have is exempt, you may be\n\u201c judgment proof .\u201d If you\u2019re not judgment proof, you don\u2019t\ndispute the amount, and the lawsuit was filed on time, try\nto negotiate a payment agreement with the creditor.\nCredit counseling can help with negotiations.

      "reference_material_content": "WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\nFact Sheet #30: Wage Garnishment Protections of the\nConsumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA)\nDecember 2024\nThis fact sheet provides general information concerning the CCPA\u2019s limits on the amount that employers may withhold from a person\u2019s\nearnings in response to a garnishment order, and the CCPA\u2019s protection from termination because of garnishment for any single debt.\nWage Garnishments\nA wage garnishment is any legal or equitable procedure through which some portion of a person\u2019s earnings is required to be withheld for the\npayment of a debt. Most garnishments are made by court order. Other types of legal or equitable procedures for garnishment include IRS or\nstate tax collection agency levies for unpaid taxes and federal agency administrative garnishments for non-tax debts owed to the federal\ngovernment.\nWage garnishments do not include voluntary wage assignments \u2013 that is, situations in which employees voluntarily agree that their\nemployers may turn over some specified amount of their earnings to a creditor or creditors.\nLimitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe CCPA limits the amount of an individual\u2019s earnings that may be garnished and protects an employee from being fired if pay is garnished\nfor only one debt. The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division administers the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, which\napply in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories and possessions. The wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA protect\neveryone who receives personal earnings.\nThe Wage and Hour Division has authority to enforce against employers the limits on the amount that may be garnished and the protections\nfrom termination because of garnishment for any single debt. Questions relating to other garnishment issues should be directed to the court\nor agency initiating the garnishment action. For example, questions regarding the priority given to certain garnishments over others are not\nmatters covered by the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA and may be referred to the court or agency initiating the action. The CCPA\ncontains no provisions controlling the priorities of garnishments, which are determined by state or other federal laws. However, in no event\nmay the amount of any individual\u2019s disposable earnings that may be garnished exceed the percentages specified in the CCPA (see below for\nmore information).\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings that may be Garnished (General)\nThe amount of pay subject to garnishment is based on an employee\u2019s \u201cdisposable earnings,\u201d which is the amount of earnings left after\nlegally required deductions are made. Examples of such deductions include federal, state, and local taxes, and the employee\u2019s share of\nSocial Security, Medicare and State Unemployment Insurance tax. It also includes withholdings for employee retirement systems required by\nlaw.\nDeductions not required by law \u2013 such as those for voluntary wage assignments, union dues, health and life insurance, contributions to\ncharitable causes, purchases of savings bonds, retirement plan contributions (except those required by law) and payments to employers for\npayroll advances or purchases of merchandise \u2013 usually may not be subtracted from gross earnings when calculating disposable earnings\nunder the CCPA.\n\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA set the maximum amount that may be garnished in any workweek or pay period, regardless of\nthe number of garnishment orders received by the employer. For ordinary garnishments (i.e., those not for support, bankruptcy, or any state\nor federal tax), the weekly amount may not exceed the lesser of two figures: 25% of the employee\u2019s disposable earnings, or the amount by\nwhich an employee\u2019s disposable earnings are greater than 30 times the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 an hour).\nTherefore, if the pay period is weekly and disposable earnings are $217.50 ($7.25 \u00d7 30) or less, there can be no garnishment. If disposable\nearnings are more than $217.50 but less than $290 ($7.25 \u00d7 40), the amount above $217.50 can be garnished. If disposable earnings are $290\nor more, a maximum of 25% can be garnished. When pay periods cover more than one week, multiples of the weekly restrictions must be\nused to calculate the maximum amounts that may be garnished. The table and examples at the end of this fact sheet illustrate these\namounts.\nMAXIMUM GARNISHMENT OF DISPOSABLE EARNINGS (GENERALLY) BASED ON CURRENT FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF $7.25 PER HOUR\nWeekly Biweekly Semimonthly Monthly\n$217.50 or less: $435.00 or less: $471.25 or less: $942.50 or less:\nNONE NONE NONE NONE\nMore than $217.50 but less More than $435.00 but less More than $471.25 but less than More than $942.50 but less than\nthan $290.00: than $580.00: $628.33: $1256.66:\nAmount ABOVE $217.50 Amount ABOVE $435.00 Amount ABOVE $471.25 Amount ABOVE $942.50\n$290.00 or more: $580.00 or more: $628.33 or more: $1256.66 or more:\nMAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25% MAXIMUM 25%\nAs discussed below, these limitations do not apply to certain bankruptcy court orders, or to garnishments to recover debts due for state or\nfederal taxes, and different limitations apply to garnishments pursuant to court orders for child support or alimony.\nLimitations on the Amount of Earnings That May be Garnished for Child\nSupport and Alimony\nThe wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA also limit the amount of earnings that may be garnished pursuant to court orders for child\nsupport or alimony. The garnishment law allows up to 50% of a worker\u2019s disposable earnings to be garnished for these purposes if the\nworker is supporting another spouse or child, or up to 60% if the worker is not. An additional 5% may be garnished for support payments\nmore than l2 weeks in arrears.\nDefinition of Earnings\nThe CCPA defines earnings as compensation paid or payable for personal services, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and\nperiodic payments from a pension or retirement program. Payments from an employment-based disability plan are also earnings.\nEarnings may include payments received in lump sums, including:\ncommissions;\ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary bonuses;\nproductivity or performance bonuses;\nprofit sharing;\nreferral and sign-on bonuses;\nmoving or relocation incentive payments;\nattendance, safety, and cash service awards;\n\nretroactive merit increases;\npayment for working during a holiday;\nworkers\u2019 compensation payments for wage replacement, whether paid periodically or in a lump sum;\ntermination pay (e.g., payment of last wages, as well as any outstanding accrued benefits);\nseverance pay; and,\nback and front pay payments from insurance settlements.\nIn determining whether certain lump-sum payments are earnings under the CCPA, the central inquiry is whether the employer paid the\namount in question for the employee\u2019s services. If the lump-sum payment is made in exchange for personal services rendered, then like\npayments received periodically, it will be subject to the CCPA\u2019s garnishment limitations. Conversely, lump-sum payments that are unrelated\nto personal services rendered are not earnings under the CCPA. Similarly, payments and reimbursements to employees pursuant to an\nemployer-provided educational assistance program under IRS Code 127 do not constitute earnings for purposes of the CCPA\u2019s limitations on\nwage garnishment.\nFor employees who receive tips, the cash wages paid directly by the employer and the amount of any tip credit claimed by the employer\nunder federal or state law are earnings for the purposes of the wage garnishment law. Tips received in excess of the tip credit amount or in\nexcess of the wages paid directly by the employer (if no tip credit is claimed or allowed) are not earnings for purposes of the CCPA.\nExceptions to Limitations on Wage Garnishments\nThe wage garnishment law specifies that its limitations on the amount of earnings that may be garnished do not apply to certain bankruptcy\ncourt orders, or to debts due for federal or state taxes.\nIf a state wage garnishment law differs from the wage garnishment provisions of the CCPA, the law resulting in the lower amount of earnings\nbeing garnished must be observed."

Fact-Checked\nWashington bankruptcy exemptions protect your property when filing for bankruptcy, and becoming familiar with them before filing can help you\ndetermine whether your assets are at risk. If you have more questions, read How to File Bankruptcy in Washington State. You'll find answers, helpful\nchecklists, and an interactive bankruptcy quiz link.\nIn This Article\nHow Do Bankruptcy Exemptions Work?\n\u201cCreditors receive bankruptcy funds when a bankruptcy filer owns \"nonexempt\" property not covered by a\nbankruptcy exemption.\u201d\nBankruptcy helps struggling people get back on their feet by lessening their debt burden, not stripping them of everything they own. Exemptions\nallow bankruptcy filers to keep things needed to maintain a home and employment. To determine whether your property is protected under\nexemption laws, you'll compare your property to the available laws. Most filers must use state exemption laws, but some states allow filers to use the\nfederal exemption laws instead.\nHowever, paying creditors is also an important consideration. Bankruptcy exemptions balance these interests by letting filers keep necessary\nproperty but not unnecessary luxury items.\nCreditors receive bankruptcy funds when a bankruptcy filer owns \"nonexempt\" property not covered by a bankruptcy exemption. In Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, the trustee responsible for the case sells the nonexempt property and pays creditors with the proceeds. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, filers\nmust pay an amount equal to the nonexempt portion through the Chapter 13 repayment plan, which the trustee forwards to creditors. (You'll find a\nmore extensive explanation of Chapters 7 and 13 below under the heading \"What Are the Differences Between Chapters 7 and 13 Bankruptcy?\")\nExample. When Maria filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, she had $5,000 in her checking account. In her bankruptcy petition, she listed her state's $500\ncash exemption and gave the nonexempt $4,500 to the bankruptcy trustee.\nExample. Harold owned an RV worth $25,000 when he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His state's exemption statutes didn't protect RVs, so he\nwas required to pay the value of the RV to creditors as part of his monthly Chapter 13 payment.\nNot Sure What to Expect in Bankruptcy?\n\u2022 Explore what bankruptcy can do for you.\n\u2022 Learn what to avoid doing before bankruptcy.\n\u2022 Discover the differences between Chapters 7 and 13.\nFor more targeted information, try our 10-question bankruptcy quiz. It can help identify bankruptcy issues that are best handled by a bankruptcy\nlawyer.\nWill Washington Bankruptcy Exemptions Protect My Property?\nYes, but you have two choices in Washington. You can use Washington state exemptions and federal nonbankruptcy exemptions. Or you can use\nfederal bankruptcy exemptions. You'll find both lists below. In many cases, married filers can double the exemption amount when filing together when\nthey both own the property. Check with a local bankruptcy lawyer for specifics.\nWhat Are the Washington Bankruptcy Exemptions?\nCaution: The state exemptions are not being updated in real time and should not be relied upon; they should only be used as a general guide. Some\nstate exemption amounts could be higher, and your state may have changed the law by adding new exemptions or deleting old ones. You must verify\nexemption availability through independent research or by consulting a local bankruptcy attorney.\n\nHomestead Exemption\nA homestead exemption helps you keep your residential house after bankruptcy. The Washington homestead exemption is much more generous\nthan the federal homestead exemption. Washington's homestead exemption amount is the greater of $125,000 or the previous year's median\nproperty value for the county where the property is located, which changes yearly. For instance, the 2024 median property value amounts range from\n$485,000 (across most of the state) to $823,000 (check with a local bankruptcy lawyer). Washington Center for Real Estate Research publishes the\nexemptable property values.\nYou can use the homestead exemption to protect personal property used as a residence, such as a mobile home, but the exemption amount is\nreduced significantly. Spouses can't double Washington's homestead exemption. (RCW \u00a7\u00a7 6.13.010, 6.13.020, 6.13.030.) Learn more about\nprotecting your home in bankruptcy.\nMotor Vehicle Exemption\nA motor vehicle exemption helps you maintain transportation after bankruptcy. A filer can exempt the equity in one motor vehicle up to $15,000 in\nvalue using Washington's motor vehicle exemption. Spouses filing jointly can each exempt a vehicle. (RCW \u00a7 6.15.010(1)(d)(iii).) Find out other\nrequirements you'll need to meet to protect a car in bankruptcy.\nWildcard Exemption\nA filer can exempt up to $10,000 worth of personal property, with some exceptions, using Washington's wildcard exemption. For instance, the\namount you can protect in cash and bank accounts is limited to $2,000 for people with consumer debts and $2,500 for filers with student loans.\n(RCW \u00a7 6.15.010(1)(d)(ii).)\nTools of the Trade Exemption\n\u2022 A debtor can exempt up to $15,000 in tools, instruments, and materials used to carry on his or her trade. Special exemptions are available\nfor farmers, physicians, attorneys, and clergymen. (RCW \u00a7 6.15.010(1)(e)(i)-(iii).)\nPersonal Property Exemptions\n\u2022 Clothing.

The deduction allows eligible\ntaxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of their QBI, plus 20 percent of\nqualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified\npublicly traded partnership (PTP) income. Income earned through a C\ncorporation or by providing services as an employee is not eligible for\nthe deduction. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or\nbusiness, see Determining your qualified trades or businesses in the\nInstructions for Form 8995-A or Form 8995.\nThe deduction is available regardless of whether taxpayers itemize\ndeductions on Schedule A or take the standard deduction. Eligible\ntaxpayers can claim the deduction for tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017, and ending on or before December 31, 2025.\n\nThe deduction has two components.\n1. QBI component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of QBI from a domestic business operated as a sole\nproprietorship or through a partnership, S corporation, trust, or\nestate. The QBI Component is subject to limitations, depending on\nthe taxpayer's taxable income which may include the type of trade\nor business, the amount of W-2 wages paid by the qualified trade or\nbusiness, and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition\n(UBIA) of qualified property held by the trade or business. It may\nalso be reduced by the patron reduction if the taxpayer is a patron\nof an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.\n2. REIT/PTP component. This component of the deduction equals 20\npercent of qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP income. This\ncomponent is not limited by W-2 wages or the UBIA of qualified\nproperty. Depending on the taxpayer's taxable income, the amount\nof PTP income that qualifies may be limited depending on the type\nof the PTP's trade or business.\nThe deduction is limited to the lesser of the QBI component plus the\nREIT/PTP component or 20 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income\nminus net capital gain.\nQBI is the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction,\nand loss from any qualified trade or business, including income from\npartnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships, and certain trusts.\nGenerally, this includes, but is not limited to, the deductible part of\n\nself-employment tax, self-employed health insurance, and deductions\nfor contributions to qualified retirement plans (e.g., SEP, SIMPLE and\nqualified plan deductions).\nQBI does not include items such as:\nItems that are not properly includable in taxable income\nInvestment items such as capital gains or losses\nInterest income not properly allocable to a trade or business\nWage income\nIncome that is not effectively connected with the conduct of\nbusiness within the United States\nCommodities transactions or foreign currency gains or losses\nCertain dividends and payments in lieu of dividends\nIncome, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts\nAnnuities, unless received in connection with the trade or business\nAmounts received as reasonable compensation from an S\ncorporation\nAmounts received as guaranteed payments from a partnership\nPayments received by a partner for services other than in a capacity\nas a partner\nQualified REIT dividends\nPTP income\nSolely for the purposes of section 199A, a safe harbor is available to\nindividuals and owners of passthrough entities who seek to claim the\ndeduction under section 199A with respect to a rental real estate\nenterprise.

      "reference_material_content": "Here's how you know\nAdoption Credit\nIf you adopt an eligible child, you may be able to claim the Adoption\nCredit or income exclusion for employer-provided adoption benefits.\nQualified adoption expenses are limited to $17,280 per qualifying child\nfor 2025. The credit and the exclusion apply to international, domestic,\nprivate or public foster care adoptions.\nBeginning in tax year 2025, a portion of the Adoption Credit is\nrefundable up to $5,000. The non-refundable portion of the credit can\nbe carried forward for a maximum of 5 years; however, it cannot result\nin a refund. Any remaining non-refundable portion after 5 years is\nforfeited.\nOn this page\nWho\u2019s eligible\nQualified expenses\nExclude expenses from income\nRules for children with special needs\nWhen to claim\n\nFigure the credit\nClaim the credit\nAmend an incorrect return\nEligibility\nYou are eligible for the Adoption Credit if you meet these criteria:\nYour modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) was $259,190 or less in\n2025. The credit is available but reduced if your MAGI was between\n$259,191 and $299,189. The credit is unavailable if your MAGI was\n$299,190 or more.\nIf married, you must file jointly to claim the credit. Exceptions exist\nfor married filing separately, and you can amend past returns to\nchange your filing status if needed.\nYou may qualify if you're a registered domestic partner in a State\nthat allows second-parent adoption. However, you cannot claim\nthe credit for expenses related to adopting your spouse\u2019s child.\nA \u201cqualified child\u201d for the Adoption Credit must be:\nUnder age 18, or\nPhysically or mentally incapable of self-care.\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see whether you qualify to claim\nthe Adoption Credit.\nQualified expenses\nQualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary expenses\nyou paid to adopt, including:\n\nAdoption fees\nAttorney fees\nCourt costs\nTravel expenses (including meals and lodging) while away from\nhome\nOther expenses directly related to, or for the principal purpose of,\nthe legal adoption\nExpenses paid before identifying an eligible child, such as home\nstudy fees\nExpenses that don\u2019t qualify for the credit\nExpenses aren\u2019t eligible if they are:\nTo adopt your spouse\u2019s child\nFor a surrogate parent arrangement\nAllowed for another federal tax credit or deduction\nPaid by a Federal, State or local program\nReimbursed by your employer\nExclude expenses from income\nIf your employer provides adoption benefits for qualified expenses, you\nmay not have to include those benefits in your income, which means\nyou may not have to pay taxes on them. You can exclude up to $17,280\nfrom your income in 2025 if your employer paid you those benefits:\nUnder a written qualified adoption assistance program\nDirectly or through a third party\n\nYou can find these payments on your Form W-2, Box 12, Code T, or your\nsalary may have been reduced to pay these benefits.\nSubtract this employer-provided benefit from your income before you\ncalculate the adoption tax credit. See Employer-Provided Adoption\nBenefits for more information.\nRules for children with special needs\nBeginning in 2025, Indian tribal governments have the same authority\nas State governments to determine whether a child has special needs\nfor the purpose of claiming the Adoption Credit.\nFor special needs adoptions, a child qualifies if they:\nAre a U.S. citizen, and\nA state or Indian tribal government has determined the child:\nCan't or shouldn't be returned to their parents\u2019 home, and\nIs not likely to be adopted without assistance to the adoptive\nfamily.\nAcceptable documentation of the state or Indian tribal government\u2019s\ndetermination of special needs includes, but is not limited to:\nAn adoption assistance or subsidy agreement issued by the state,\ntribal court or tribal government representative\nCertification from the state, county or tribal welfare agency, or\ntribal government verifying that the child is approved to receive\nadoption assistance\nCertification from the state, county, or tribal welfare agency, or\ntribal government verifying that the child has special needs\n\nAn official letter on state, county, or tribal government letterhead\nconfirming the special needs determination\nFind examples of State and Indian tribal government determinations\nfor special needs in the Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption\nExpenses.\nIf you adopt a child with special needs, you may be able to claim:\nThe full income exclusion, even if your employer didn\u2019t pay\nexpenses (if your employer has a written qualified adoption\nassistance program)\nThe full credit even if you didn't pay any qualified adoption\nexpenses\nWhen to claim the credit\nDomestic adoptions: Claim expenses each year as you incur or pay\nthem as long as the adoption is finalized. Claim expense the year\nafter you incur or pay them if the adoption is still in progress and\nnot final. If the child is a U.S. citizen or resident, you may claim the\ncredit even if the adoption is unsuccessful.\nForeign adoptions: Claim expenses once the adoption is final. When\nit\u2019s final, you can claim all eligible expenses you paid, including in\npast years.\nAdoption of children deemed by a state or Indian tribal government\nwelfare agency as special needs or hard to place: Claim expenses\nwhen the adoption is final.\n\nFind examples of these timing rules to claim the credit in\nthe Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses.\nFigure the credit and exclusion amounts\nThe credit amount applies to the adoption of each child\nindividually, not each calendar year. If you claim expenses in more\nthan one year for the same adoption (final or in progress), you must\nsubtract past credit amounts you claimed from your remaining credit.\nExample: You claimed a $3,000 Adoption Credit in 2024 for expenses\nincurred in 2023 for the adoption of a child that was not finalized\nduring that year. In 2025, you paid $17,280 for additional expenses\nrelated to the adoption of the same child, which was finalized during\nthe year. Since you are claiming expenses related to the adoption of\nthe same child and have already claimed a $3,000 Adoption Credit in\npast years, you can only claim a credit of $14,280 in 2025 ($17,280 less\nthe $3,000 credit you previously claimed).\nThe income exclusion is in addition to the credit, but you can\u2019t\nclaim both for the same expenses. You must claim any allowable\nexclusion before claiming any allowable credit. To do this, complete\nPart III of Form 8839 before you complete Part II.\nExample: In 2025, you paid $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses, and\nyour employer reimbursed you for $4,000. You can exclude $4,000 from\nyour income. Your maximum credit is $6,000 ($10,000 less the $4,000\nemployer reimbursement).\n\nIf you adopt a child deemed to be special needs (previously defined),\nyou may be able to take the income exclusion even if your employer\ndidn\u2019t pay qualified expenses.\nClaim the credit\nTo claim the Adoption Credit or exclusion:\nComplete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, and attach the\nform to your tax return.\nReport the required information about the eligible child on Form\n8839, Part I. The child\u2019s identifying number can be their Social\nSecurity number, adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN) or\nindividual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Use Form W-7A\nPDF , Application for Adoption Tax Identification Number for\nPending U.S. Adoptions (Instructions PDF ), to receive an\nATIN. Note: See Instructions for Form 8839 if you can\u2019t give\ncomplete information about an eligible child you tried to adopt in\nprior years because the adoption was either unsuccessful or wasn\u2019t\nfinal by the end of 2025.\nKeep the adoption documentation for your records.\nAmend an incorrect return\nIf you claimed an incorrect credit amount, file an amended return. You\ncan check the status of an amended return around 3 weeks after you\nsubmit it. You should generally allow 8 to 12 weeks for your Form 1040-\nX to be processed.\n\nIf you claimed the credit and we reject or reduce it, you can consider\nappealing it.\nRelated\nForm 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses\nInstructions for Form 8839\nAdoption Taxpayer Identification Number\nPublication 5851, New Parents Check eligibility for these tax credits\nand deductions PDF\nPublication 6123, Adoption Tax Credit Checklist PDF\nPublication 6124, 5 Things to Know About the Adoption Tax Credit\nPDF\nPage Last Reviewed or Updated: 05-Jan-\n2026"

Other information may be appropriate\nfor your specific type of business.\nWhat is self-employment tax?\nWho must pay self-employment tax?\nHow do I pay self-employment tax?\n\nWhat is self-employment tax?\nSelf-employment tax is a tax consisting of Social Security and Medicare\ntaxes primarily for individuals who work for themselves. It is similar to\nthe Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from the pay of most\nwage earners.\nEmployers calculate Social Security and Medicare taxes for most wage\nearners. However, you calculate self-employment tax (SE tax) using\nSchedule SE, Self-Employment Tax, (Form 1040 PDF or 1040-SR). Also,\nyou can deduct the employer-equivalent portion of your SE tax when\ncalculating your adjusted gross income. Wage earners cannot deduct\nSocial Security and Medicare taxes.\nSelf-employment tax rate\nThe self-employment tax rate is 15.3%. The rate consists of two parts:\n12.4% for social security (old-age, survivors, and disability insurance)\nand 2.9% for Medicare (hospital insurance).\nFor 2024, the first $168,600 of your combined wages, tips, and net\nearnings is subject to any combination of the social security part of\nself-employment tax, social security tax, or railroad retirement (tier 1)\ntax. (Refer to Schedule SE for prior year(s) SE tax rates).\nIf your wages and tips are subject to social security tax or railroad\nretirement tier 1 tax, and total at least $168,600, do not pay the 12.4%\nsocial security part of the SE tax on any of your net earnings. However,\nall of your wages and tips are subject to the 2.9% Medicare part of the\nSE tax on all your net earnings.\n\nYou are liable for an additional 0.9% Medicare Tax if your wages,\ncompensation, or self-employment income (together with that of your\nspouse if filing a joint return) exceed the threshold amount for your\nfiling status:\nThreshold\nFiling status amount\nMarried filing jointly $250,000\nMarried filing separate $125,000\nSingle $200,000\nHead of household (with qualifying person) $200,000\nQualifying surviving spouse with dependent $200,000\nchild\nFor more information, refer to the Questions and answers for the\nadditional Medicare tax page.\nIf you use a tax year other than the calendar year, you must use the tax\nrate and maximum earnings limit in effect at the beginning of your tax\nyear.

This deduction\nonly affects your income tax. It does not affect either your net earnings\nfrom self-employment or your self-employment tax.\nIf you file Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return, or Form 1040-SR,\nU.S. Income Tax Return for Seniors, with Schedule C, Profit or Loss from\nBusiness, you may be eligible to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit\n(EITC).

See Instructions for\nForm 1040 and Form 1040-SR PDF and Instructions for Schedule SE\nPDF for calculating and claiming the deduction.\nWho must pay self-employment tax?\nYou must pay self-employment tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040 or\nForm 1040-SR) if either of the following applies.\nYour net earnings from self-employment (excluding church\nemployee income) were $400 or more.\nYou had church employee income of $108.28 or more.\n\nGenerally, your net earnings from self-employment are subject to self-\nemployment tax. If you are self-employed as a sole proprietor or\nindependent contractor, you generally use Schedule C to figure net\nearnings from self-employment.\nIf you have earnings subject to self-employment tax, use Schedule SE\nto figure your net earnings from self-employment. Before you figure\nyour net earnings, you generally need to figure your total earnings\nsubject to self-employment tax.\nNote: The self-employment tax rules apply no matter how old you are\nand even if you are already receiving Social Security or Medicare.\nFamily caregivers and self-employment tax\nSpecial rules apply to workers who perform in-home services for\nelderly or disabled individuals (caregivers). Caregivers are typically\nemployees of the individuals for whom they provide services because\nthey work in the homes of the elderly or disabled individuals and these\nindividuals have the right to tell the caregivers what needs to be done.\nSee the Family caregivers and self-employment tax page and\nPublication 926, Household Employer\u2019s Tax Guide, for more details.\nHow do I pay self-employment tax?\nTo pay self-employment tax, you must have a Social Security number\n(SSN) or an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).\n\nObtaining a Social Security number\nIf you never had an SSN, apply for one using Form SS-5, Application for\na Social Security Card.

If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to zero,\nyou can have 40 percent of any remaining amount of the credit (up to\n$1,000) refunded to you.\nThe amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified\neducation expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent\nof the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that\nstudent.\nWho is an eligible student for AOTC?\nUse the Interactive Tax Assistant to see if you\u2019re eligible to claim an\neducation credit.\n\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the student must:\nBe pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential in a\npost-secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a\n\uf08e\nUS Department of Education student aid program.\nBe enrolled at least half-time for at least 1 academic period*\nbeginning in the tax year\nNot have finished the first 4 years of higher education at the\nbeginning of the tax year\nNot have claimed AOTC or the former Hope Credit for more than 4\ntax years; AOTC years do not have to be consecutive but do include\nyears the Hope credit was claimed for the same student\nNot have a felony drug conviction at the end of the tax year\n*Academic period can be semesters, trimesters, quarters or any other\nperiod of study such as a summer school session. Schools determine\nacademic periods. For schools that use clock or credit hours and don\u2019t\nhave academic terms, the payment period may be treated as an\nacademic period.\nCourses can be online.\nClaiming the credit\nTo claim AOTC, you must complete the Form 8863 and attach the\ncompleted form to your tax return.\nTo be eligible for AOTC, the law requires the student to have received\nForm 1098-T, Tuition Statement, from an eligible educational\ninstitution, domestic or foreign. Generally, students get the form from\ntheir school by Jan. 31.\n\nIf you received a Form 1098-T, this statement will help you figure your\ncredit. The form will have an amount in Box 1 to show the amounts\nreceived during the year. This amount may not be the amount you can\nclaim. For information on what amount to claim, see qualified\neducation expenses in Tax Benefits for Education, Pub. 970. Check the\nform to make sure it\u2019s correct. If it isn\u2019t correct or you don\u2019t receive the\nform but should, contact the institution.\nIf you didn\u2019t receive Form 1098-T, you may still be eligible to claim a\ncredit.

Debt Avalanche vs. Debt\nSnowball\nSarah Brady, NFCC July 1, 2024\n\nWhen you set your mind on a goal, you want to achieve it in\nthe best way possible. But what does \u201cbest\u201d mean, exactly?\nSometimes it depends on the person.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re training for a marathon.\nNaturally, your goal is to finish the race \u2014 and it\u2019s an\nimpressive feat to run 26.2 miles! For others, the goal is to\nmake a certain time, break a personal record or finish in first\nplace.\nPaying off debt works the same way. The goal of being debt\nfree is a great objective for anyone, but there\u2019s more than one\nway to do it. For people who struggle with motivation, the\nsnowball method is usually best. For people who want to\nsave money in interest charges, the avalanche method is the\nway to go.\nThe Debt Snowball vs. The\nDebt Avalanche\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the debt snowball or the debt\navalanche methods before, let us explain.\n\nThese are two different strategies for paying off credit cards\nand some other types of debt. Both are considered do-it-\nyourself (DIY) methods, because you can follow them on\nyour own, without any outside help. Here\u2019s how they work.\nHow the Debt Avalanche Works\nThe debt avalanche is a strategy in which you prioritize\npaying off debt based on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\n\u2014 starting from highest rate to lowest. This can also be\nreferred to as the\u201cstacking method\u201d or the \u201cdebt ladder.\u201d\nTo be clear, when using this method, you still make the\nminimum monthly payments on all of your debts, but you put\nyour extra money toward the debt with the highest APR (a\nnumber that represents your interest rate and fees).\nOnce the first debt is paid off, you continue this method by\npaying off the account with the next highest interest rate.\nFollow this pattern until you\u2019re debt free.\nIf that sounds simple, it is. It\u2019s not a magic formula for\nerasing debt, but it does help you focus on a goal and save\nmoney while becoming debt free. Just make sure you avoid\ntaking on new debt while using this method, or it will take\nyou longer to reach your goal.\n\nHow the Debt Snowball Works\nThe debt snowball method is a payment strategy in which\nyou pay off debts in order of the balances you owe \u2014 from\nsmallest to largest.\nJust like a snowball starts small and gets bigger as it rolls,\nyou start with the smallest debt and work your way up. Of\ncourse, you continue to make your debt payments, but you\npay just the minimum monthly payments on most accounts\nand put all your extra cash toward the account with the\nsmallest balance. Repeat this process until all debts are\npaid.\nAs you pay off accounts, you eliminate monthly payments,\nfreeing up even more money to put toward your next\nsmallest debt. In other words, this method is all about\nmomentum and seeing progress as quickly as possible.\nTo recap, here\u2019s how the two methods compare:\nDebt Avalanche Debt Snowball\nPriority Highest APR Lowest balance\nSave money on Pay off individual\ninterest accounts faster\nBenefits Shorter timeframe More motivation to\nto pay off all debt stick with your plan\n\nDebt Avalanche Debt Snowball\nPriority Highest APR Lowest balance\nDrawback Less motivating More expensive\nChoosing the Best Method\nfor You\nIf you\u2019re making a plan to pay off debt and you need to\nchoose which method to use, consider these details first.\nYour financial personality\nThink about how each repayment option aligns with your\nfinancial personality, meaning your attitudes, habits,\nstrengths and challenges when it comes to money.\nIf you\u2019re someone who\u2019s motivated by efficiency and\nembraces savings over spontaneity, then the debt avalanche\nmethod may be the perfect fit. You\u2019re more likely to stay\ncommitted to the plan, even if it takes longer to pay off\nindividual accounts.\nOn the other hand, if you like to see quick results and you\nstruggle with reaching financial goals, the debt snowball is\nideal. You won\u2019t mind the fact that repayment is slightly more\n\nexpensive, because it\u2019s worth the joy of seeing account\nbalances hit $0 as quickly as possible.\nThe amounts you owe\nBefore you make a plan, be sure to take an inventory of your\ndebt. Write down how much you owe one each account,\nalong with the interest rate.\nDo you owe similar amounts on each account? If so, choose\nthe debt avalanche, since it could actually help you pay off\naccounts sooner and save you money. If you have a wide\nrange of balances, the snowball can still make sense.\nStudent loan debt\nEach type of debt has different repayment options, and those\noptions can impact your payment strategy. For example,\nfederal student loans give you far more repayment options\nthan private student loans.\nFor federal loans, the Department of Education (ED) offers\nIncome-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans with payments as low\nas $0 a month. Plus, the ED has debt forgiveness programs\n\nand can pause your payments if you\u2019re facing a financial\nhardship.\nBy contrast, private student loan lenders are not required to\noffer any help to students. In other words, it\u2019s worth checking\nto see what you qualify for before sending extra money to\nyour federal student loan servicer.\nLow APR\nOnce you eliminate your high-APR debt \u2014 meaning debt with\nrates of 8% or higher \u2014 you\u2019ll want to change your approach.\nLower interest debt usually includes accounts that are\n\u201csecured\u201d by collateral, such as mortgages and home equity\nloans. You can often get a better payoff by making the\nminimum payments on these accounts, and putting your\nextra cash into a low-risk investment such as a retirement\naccount (especially one with an employer match) or a\nmutual fund.\nEliminate debt for good\nAs you can see, the \u201cbest\u201d way to pay off debt depends on\nyour situation. The most important thing is to stay\ncommitted to eliminating debt with whichever plan you\nchoose, whether it\u2019s the debt avalanche or the debt snowball\nmethod."

Companies that design credit scores each use their own\ncomplicated mathematical formulas, called scoring models, to create your credit\nscore from the information in your credit report. Factors that make up a typical\ncredit score include the number and type of loan accounts you have, whether you\nmake your payments on time, and your current unpaid debt.\nCompanies use credit scores to make decisions such as whether to offer a person\na mortgage, credit card, auto loan, or other credit product. Credit scores are also\nused to determine the interest rate a person receives on a loan or credit card, as\nwell as the credit limit they\u2019re offered.\nWho collects my credit history?\nCompanies collect consumers\u2019 financial and credit information from businesses\nthat furnish it to them. This may include not only information about loans and credit\ncards, but also things like payment history for rent and utilities. Multiple companies\ncalculate and sell credit scores. Thus, you may have more than one credit score,\nand the scores may be different from one another. Credit scores may vary as a\nresult of differing scoring models used or information gathered to calculate the\nscores. Banks, credit unions, credit card companies, and lenders may use credit\nscores from a range of credit reporting companies.\nWhat do credit scores represent?\nCredit scores provide a snapshot of a person\u2019s financial situation. They provide a\nway for lenders to determine whether they will lend to you or under what terms they\nwill lend to you. A higher credit score means you are predicted to be less of a risk.\nUsually a high credit score makes it easier to get a loan and may result in a better\ninterest rate, but lenders have their own cutoffs to determine eligibility. Most credit\nscores range from 300 to 850.\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 1 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\nFICO (calculated using scoring models designed by Fair Isaac Corporation) and\nVantageScore (calculated using scoring models designed by VantageScore\nSolutions) are two of the most commonly used credit scores.\nView two different ranges of credit scores:\nFICO credit scores\nVantageScore 3.0\nHow are credit scores calculated?\nCredit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit report. Even\nthough different credit scores have different mathematical formulas, they all use\nthe information from your credit report. So, while some pieces of information in\nyour credit reports may be weighted somewhat differently depending on who\nis calculating your score, the key is to understand the information in your credit\nreports. A good rule to live by is to check your credit reports every year through\nannualcreditreport.com and fix any errors.\nWhile detailed information about the way that FICO and VantageScore (and other\ncredit score companies) calculate their scores is not public, these companies\nprovide a general sense of what goes into a credit score.\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 2 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\nView two credit scoring models:\nFICO model\nLength of credit\nhistory (15%)\nTypes of credit used (10%) Payment history (35%)\nLength of credit\nhistory (15%)\nTypes of credit used (10%) Payment history (35%)\nNew credit history Total debt (30%)\n(10%)\nNew credit history Total debt (30%)\nRecent credit Utilization Payment history\n(10%)\n(5%) (20%) (40%)\nVantageScore model\nRecent credit Utilization Payment history\n(5%) (20%) (40%)\nAvailable Depth of credit\ncredit (3%) (21%)\nBalances (11%)\nAvailable Depth of credit\ncredit (3%) (21%)\nBalances (11%)\nBUILDING BLOCKS STUDENT HANDOUT 3 of 4\nAll about credit scores Summer 2022\n\n\u00a7 Payment history tracks whether you are paying your bills on time and as agreed.\n\u00a7 Total debt, balances, and utilization look at both total owed as well as how\nmuch available credit a person is using.\n\u00a7 Depth/length of credit history reflects how long you have had relationships with\na creditor(s); the longer your credit history with a lender, the more likely your\ncredit score will increase in this category.\n\u00a7 New/recent credit considers all new loans or accounts and includes how many\ntimes creditors have requested a person\u2019s credit report, which could be an\nindicator of risk.\n\u00a7 Types of credit used refers to a person\u2019s credit mix, which includes both\ncredit cards (known as revolving credit) and loans (which can be considered\ninstallment credit).\n\ue715\nTip\nThe way you use and repay debt affects your credit score.

A soft inquiry happens\nwhen you or someone else checks your credit\nunrelated to a specific credit application.\n\n\ue95c\nIN THIS ARTICLE\nWhat Is a Hard Credit Inquiry?\nWhat Is a Soft Credit Inquiry?\nHow to Minimize Credit Inquiries\nCan You Remove Hard Inquiries?\nInquiries are entries that appear on your credit report when your\ncredit information is accessed by a legally authorized person or\norganization (including yourself).\nCredit inquiries fall into two categories: hard inquiries and soft\ninquiries. While the two types of inquiries have some things in\ncommon, there are some key differences in their purposes and\ntheir impact on your credit.\n\nHard Inquiry vs. Soft Inquiry\nHard Inquiry Soft Inquiry\nCan temporarily lower your Doesn't affect your credit score\ncredit score\nTypically occurs when you apply May occur for a variety of reasons\nfor credit\nRequires your permission May not require your permission\nRemains on your credit reports Remains on your credit reports for\nfor two years up to two years\nWhat Is a Hard Credit Inquiry?\nA hard inquiry, also called a hard pull or hard credit check,\noccurs when a creditor accesses your credit file to assess your\ncreditworthiness and potentially approve you for a credit card,\nloan or line of credit. Depending on the lender and type of credit,\nthey may view one, two or all three of your credit reports from\nthe three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and\nEquifax).\nThe most common scenarios in which you can expect a hard\ninquiry include:\n\nApplying for a new credit card: Each credit card application\nwill likely result in a hard inquiry.\nPurchasing or leasing a car: Whether you're applying for a\nloan from a bank or dealership to buy a car or you're leasing\na car, you can expect a hard inquiry.\nBuying a house: When you apply for a mortgage, the lender\nwill do a hard pull on your credit initially, then again shortly\nbefore closing.\nApplying for a personal loan: As with other lenders,\npersonal loan lenders will do a hard credit pull when you\nformally apply for the loan.\nApplying for a private student loan: If you're applying for\nprivate student student loans, lenders will likely run a hard\ninquiry to evaluate your creditworthiness. The same is true\nif you apply for a federal direct PLUS loan, including parent\nPLUS loans.\nRequesting a credit line increase: If you ask your credit\ncard issuer to increase your credit limit, it may run a hard\ninquiry to determine your eligibility.\nRenting or leasing an apartment: This could be a hard pull\nor soft pull; check with the landlord or leasing company to\nknow for sure.\n\nHow Long Do Hard Inquiries Stay on\nYour Credit Report?\nHard inquiries remain on your credit report for up to two years,\nbut as long as you keep up with your debt payments, credit\nscores often rebound from an inquiry within a few months. Also,\nmost credit scoring models no longer count a hard inquiry in\nscore calculations at all after 12 months.\nAccording to FICO, one hard inquiry will typically reduce your\nscore by fewer than five points. However, multiple hard inquiries\nin a short period of time may have a compounding negative\neffect.\nThe only exception is if you're rate shopping for a mortgage\nloan, auto loan or student loan. In this event, FICO will ignore\nrate-shopping inquiries fewer than 30 days old and count\nmultiple inquiries as a single inquiry if they all occur within a\ncertain period\u201445 days for new FICO scoring models and 14\ndays for older models.\nWhat Is a Soft Credit Inquiry?\nSoft inquiries appear on your credit report when someone runs a\ncredit check for reasons unrelated to lending you money. A soft\npull or soft credit check can happen for several different\nreasons, including:\n\nChecking your own credit: Viewing your own credit report\ngenerates a soft inquiry.\nLoan prequalification: Some lenders may do a soft pull\nwhen you are seeking loan prequalification\u2014and in some\ncases, preapproval\u2014as part of the rate-shopping process.\nPromotional offers: A company may pull your credit to see\nif you qualify for a promotional offer. These are also called\npre-screened offers.\nEmployment background checks: Employers may perform\nsoft inquiries as part of their pre-employment screening\nprocess.\nRequesting utilities: When you apply to set up a service at a\nnew address, the utility companies might check your credit\nto determine whether you need to make a deposit.\nRenting or leasing an apartment: This could be a hard pull\nor soft pull; check with the landlord or leasing company to\nknow for sure.\nBuying insurance: In most states, auto and homeowners\ninsurance companies run a soft credit check to calculate\nyour credit-based insurance score, which may influence\nyour premium.\nAccount servicing: Some credit card companies may\noccasionally run soft credit checks on existing customers\nto evaluate whether to adjust their account terms, such as a\n\ncredit limit increase or decrease, or to see if you qualify for\na promotional offer.\nHow Long Do Soft Inquiries Stay on\nYour Credit Report?\nLike hard inquiries, soft inquiries remain on your credit reports\nfor up to two years. However, because they're not related to an\napplication for credit or a loan decision, they aren't associated\nwith greater repayment risk and, therefore, have no effect on\nyour credit score.\nHow to Minimize Credit Inquiries\nWhile a hard inquiry will rarely, if ever, be the sole reason you're\ndenied credit, it's still important to be mindful of the number of\nhard inquiries that appear on your credit report. On the flip side,\nsoft inquiries have no impact on your credit, so it's best to\nprioritize soft pulls when possible.\nIn particular, here are some ways to avoid too many hard\ninquiries:\nGet prequalified. Take advantage of prequalification offers\nbefore formally applying for credit. Prequalification typically\ninvolves a soft credit inquiry and provides an idea of your\n\neligibility\u2014and possibly even a rate quote\u2014without affecting\nyour credit score.\nUse the rate-shopping window. When shopping for a\nmortgage, auto loan or private student loan, research and\napply within a specific timeframe (inside a two-week period\nif at all possible). This will ensure that the multiple inquiries\nare treated as a single inquiry, minimizing the impact on\nyour credit score.\nLimit new credit card applications. Because credit cards\nare opened upon approval, applying for multiple credit cards\nin a short period isn't considered rate shopping. As a result,\neach hard inquiry will be counted separately. If you plan to\napply for multiple credit cards, consider spacing out your\napplications by six months or more.\nAvoid unnecessary credit. Before you apply for credit of\nany kind, carefully evaluate your financial situation, needs\nand goals to determine if it's the right decision. Also,\nconsider other ways you can accomplish your objective,\nsuch as saving up instead.\nMonitor your credit. Regularly review your credit reports to\nensure accuracy and identify any unauthorized inquiries or\npotential fraud. You can get free credit monitoring from\nExperian and receive alerts anytime there are changes to\nyour Experian credit report.\n\nCan You Remove Hard Inquiries?\nYou can't remove legitimate hard inquiries from your credit\nreports. However, if you review your credit reports and find a\nhard pull you don't recognize, it could be a red flag.\nMore specifically, it could be an indicator that someone has\nattempted to open a credit account in your name without your\nknowledge or authorization. So, if you find a hard inquiry you're\nunsure about, check for new fraudulent accounts.\nWhether or not there's a new account associated with the\ninquiry, here are some steps you can take to address the issue.\nContact the creditor. Reach out to the creditor in question\nusing the contact information included in your credit report.\nSuspicious inquiries aren't always connected to illegitimate\nactivity. For example, an unfamiliar creditor may turn out to\nbe the lending partner of a retailer where you applied for a\ncredit card or a dealership where you applied for an auto\nloan.\nFile a dispute. You have the right to dispute inaccurate\ncredit report information with the credit bureaus. You can\nfile a dispute directly with each credit reporting agency to\nget the hard inquiry removed.\n\nProtect your credit reports. You have the right to add a\nfraud alert or security freeze to your credit reports, making\nit harder for identity thieves to commit further fraud using\nyour information.\nMonitor Your Credit to Support Your\nFinancial Health\nYour credit report is a living document that's constantly\nchanging. Whether you're working to build your credit score or\nsimply to maintain the progress you've already made, it's\nimportant to check your credit regularly.\nWith Experian's free credit monitoring service, you'll get access\n\u00ae \u0398\nto your FICO Score \ue90c and Experian credit report, making it\neasy to track your progress and get insights about your credit\nhealth.

Whether you are considering buying a simple,\nfixed-rate CD or one with more complex features, here are tips for\nselecting the right CD for your financial needs and goals.\nMake sure you are purchasing a \u201cdeposit\u201d product issued by an FDIC-\ninsured bank\nNot all companies with bank-sounding names are actually banks that\nare insured by the FDIC. To verify that an institution is FDIC-insured,\ngo to BankFind (https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/bankfind)\nor contact the FDIC\u2019s toll-free Call Center at 1-877-ASK-FDIC\n(tel:18772753342). Also, get more information by reading The\nImportance of Deposit Insurance and Understanding Your Coverage\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2022-\n08.html).\nIf you purchase a CD from a third-party broker instead of directly from\nan FDIC-insured bank, you will have to rely on the broker to make your\ndeposit and acquire the CD on your behalf. The FDIC does not license\nor register deposit brokers and an unscrupulous broker could mislead\nor defraud its customers. If the broker fails to place your funds into a\nCD at an FDIC-insured bank; your money will not be insured by the\nFDIC. Also, be sure to review the account agreement and other\nsupporting documentation to confirm you are in fact purchasing a CD\nand not a financial product that is not insured by the FDIC.

You can also use the FDIC\nElectronic Deposit Insurance Estimator or \u201cEDIE\u201d (https://edie.fdic.gov/)\nto verify your deposit insurance coverage. Find more information at\nAre My Deposit Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\ninsured/).\nKnow what your deposit agreement says about your interest\npayments\nSome banks are offering CDs with variable interest rates based on a\npre-set schedule or tied to the performance of a basket of market\nindices (such as the S&P 500, bonds or foreign currency). Many\nmarket-linked CDs accrue interest only when the CD matures, not\nevery day or every month. More information on deposit disclosures is\nprovided in the January 2021 FDIC Consumer News Article\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2021-\n01.html).\nBe suspicious if the advertised CD rate is far above the competition\nCDs or other products may be offered by a company that is not\nfederally insured, in which case any money invested could be lost if\nthe company goes bankrupt. There is also a common marketing ploy\nto lure customers with a temporary high CD rate with the goal of\neventually selling them something else. A very high interest rate\n\nadvertised on an FDIC-insured bank CD could be a scheme created\nwhen a finance company or an insurance agent adds a small bonus to\nthe CD to lure people in the door and, eventually, tries to sell the\ncustomers uninsured, long-term investments that may not be in their\nbest interest.\nFind out if the CD would automatically renew at the maturity date if\nyou do not withdraw the money\nIf that is the case, check to see if the automatic renewal will be at the\n\u201cold\u201d interest rate or the current rate at the time of the renewal. If\nmarket rates have risen, it may not be to your benefit to renew at the\nold rate. Determine whether you can terminate the CD early. The\nterms of most fixed-rate CDs will allow the depositor to pay a fee to\nredeem the deposit prior to maturity. However, most market-linked\nCDs do not allow for an early redemption. Also be aware that market-\nlinked and other long-term, high-yield CDs typically have \u201ccall\u201d features\nthat give the bank the right to close the account early. A callable, fixed-\nrate CD could undermine your ability to lock in an attractive, long-term\ninterest rate. Why? If interest rates fall, the issuing bank may decide to\ncall the CD and give you back your money (plus accrued interest)\nbecause it can issue new CDs at the lower interest rates.\nBy making sure you read your deposit agreement closely, you will\nbetter understand terms of the CD you are purchasing. These CD\nshopping tips will help you choose wisely and avoid scams too.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News Banking with Apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2020-\n11.html)\nFact Sheet: What the Public Needs to Know About FDIC Deposit\nInsurance and Crypto Companies (PDF)\n(https://www.fdic.gov/news/fact-sheets/crypto-fact-sheet-7-28-22.pdf)"

As a small business owner, you may be juggling the\nexpenses of running the day-to-day operations of your business, the\ncosts of expanding your business, and the responsibilities to protect\nyour employees and your customers with your financial choices.\nKnowing you have all of that on your mind, here is some helpful\ninformation and some things to consider about banking for your\nbusiness.\nPayments from your customers\nAs a small business owner, you will need to decide how customers will\npay you. Whether or not to accept debit or credit card payments is an\nimportant decision to make. While these forms of payment are\nconvenient for customers, you may choose not to accept debit or\ncredit cards because of the fees and other costs. You may allow\ncustomers to pay using mobile apps\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/june2020.html).\nMake sure you carefully read the fine print of any mobile app you\u2019re\nconsidering, so that you are aware of any fees and limitations on\nfunds availability.\nIn general, you will want to comparison shop for a mobile app or debit\nand credit card processing service, since costs and other terms and\nconditions will vary.\n\nDeciding on whether to separate your consumer and business deposit\naccounts\nKeeping your business accounts separate from your personal\naccounts has some benefits. Also, the need for separate accounts\ngenerally increases as a business grows or becomes complex.\nAll deposits owned by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated\nassociation at the same bank are added together and insured up to\n$250,000, separately from the personal accounts\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-\nproducts-insured/) of the owners or members. Note, however, that\ndeposits of a sole proprietorship are aggregated with the owner\u2019s\nother deposits held in his/her name only.\nKeeping your business funds separate from your personal funds,\nsuch as in a business account, may limit personal liability. The\nseparation allows authorized employees to handle day-to-day\nbusiness banking tasks without those employees being involved in\nyour personal finances.\nThe\nInternal Revenue Service (PDF) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-\npdf/p583.pdf)\nalso recommends that you have a business checking account that is\nseparate from your personal accounts. One reason is because doing\nso can make recordkeeping for tax time easier.\nBusiness accounts make it possible for customers to pay with credit\ncards or use checks made out to your business. Remember, if you\ncollect and retain certain customer data, there may be legal\nrequirements to protect it.\nFor more information about what types of accounts are insured by the\nFDIC, please visit: Are My Deposits Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/financial-products-\n\ninsured)\nProtections may vary for consumer versus commercial accounts\nYour liability for unauthorized transactions on your personal debit\ncard accounts is generally capped by federal regulations \u2014 $50 or\nmore for debit cards (depending on when you notify the bank). While\nfederal law doesn't protect business debit cards from liability for\nunauthorized transactions, your bank account agreement and state\nlaws could limit your liability. The bottom line: Notify your bank\nimmediately of any problems because state laws, industry standards\nand your deposit agreements may provide\nprotections (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/bank-\naccounts/answers/know-your-rights/)\n.\nWatch out for scams targeting your business\nScammers are out there and will do what they can to exploit your\nbusiness perhaps by stealing information about customers or\nunauthorized withdrawals from a bank account as well as fraudulent\noffers and counterfeit bills. Also, here are a few scams to watch out\nfor, so you can protect your business and your money.\nRansomware is a type of malware created to lock or encrypt files on\nan electronic device like a smart phone or computer. The sender of\nthe ransomware then demands a ransom\u2014generally in the form of a\ndigital asset\u2014in exchange for unlocking or decrypting the information\non your electronic device. The scammer typically threatens to\npublically disclose or sell the compromised information, if the ransom\nis not paid. If you believe your business is a victim of a ransomware\nattack, contact law enforcement immediately. You can also contact a\nlocal field office of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-\nsafety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\nor\n\nU.S. Secret Service (PDF)\n(https://www.secretservice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2020-\n12/Preparing%20for%20a%20Cyber%20Incident%20-\n%20A%20Guide%20to%20Ransomware%20v%201.0.pdf)\nto report a ransomware attack and ask for assistance.\nPhishing is a term for scams commonly used when a criminal uses\nemail to ask you to provide personal financial information or financial\ninformation of the small business. The sender pretends to be from a\nbank, a retail store, or government agency and makes the email\nappear legitimate. The approach is often threatening or appears\nurgent in nature. Do not open links or provide financial information\nunless you are sure of the party who is interacting with you. Smishing\nis similar to phishing, but instead of using email, the criminal uses text\nmessaging to reach you.\nVishing, similar to phishing and smishing, is when scammers use\nphone services such as a live phone call, a \u201crobocall,\u201d or a voicemail to\ntry to trick you into providing personal or business information by\nsounding like a legitimate business or government official.\nTo summarize, making sure you choose the right bank for the deposit\nservices or products that you need for your business is really\nimportant. Separating your personal accounts from your business\ndeposit accounts is not only a practical way to run your business, it\nmay also be more efficient. Lastly, stay on the lookout for scams to\nhelp protect your business and customers\u2019 interests.\nAdditional resources:\nFDIC Consumer News: Need a Loan for Your New Small Business?\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/2023-05/need-loan-\nyour-new-small-business)\n\nFDIC: Money Smart for Small Business\n(https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/money-smart-small-\nbusiness)\nFDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance\n(https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-\ndeposit-insurance)\nSmall Business Administration (SBA):\nOpen a business bank account (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/launch-your-business/open-business-bank-account)\nSBA:\nStrengthen your cybersecurity (https://www.sba.gov/business-\nguide/manage-your-business/strengthen-your-cybersecurity)\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency:\nStopRansomeware.gov (https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\nFor more consumer resources, visit FDIC.gov (https://www.fdic.gov/) ,\nor go to the FDIC Knowledge Center\n(https://ask.fdic.gov/fdicinformationandsupportcenter/s/public-\ninformation?language=en_US).

SWIFT codes and IBANs are essential for getting your\nmoney where it needs to go, but they serve completely different\nfunctions in the global banking system.\nWhile both help your money reach its destination, understanding\ntheir distinct roles can save you time and prevent transfer delays.\nThis article breaks down what these codes are, how they differ, and\nexactly which one you'll need for your specific transfer situation.\nWhat is an IBAN?\n\nWhile SWIFT codes direct your money to the right bank, an IBAN\npinpoints the exact account where your funds should land. IBAN\nstands for International Bank Account Number and identifies the\nspecific recipient's bank account.\nHow IBAN works\nIt's widely used in Europe, the Middle East, and several other\nregions\nIBANs help reduce transfer errors and streamline processing\ntimes\nUnlike SWIFT codes that identify banks, IBANs identify\nindividual accounts\nBreaking down an IBAN\nAn IBAN contains up to 34 alphanumeric characters in this structure:\nCC XX BBBB AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA\nCC: Country code (2 letters)\nXX: Check digits (2 numbers for error detection)\nBBBB: Bank identifier (varies by country)\nAAAA... : The recipient's unique account number\nFor example, AT11 2222 3333 4444 5555 6666 7777 would be a\nbank account in Austria.\n\nWhat is a SWIFT code?\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunication. These codes act as your bank's international\naddress, ensuring your money finds its way through the global\nbanking network. When you send money abroad, this unique\nidentifier helps direct your transfer to exactly the right financial\ninstitution.\nHow SWIFT works\nEach bank has its own unique SWIFT code (sometimes called\na BIC, or Bank Identifier Code)\nThe SWIFT system doesn't actually move your money \u2014 it\nsends the payment instructions between banks\nThese codes ensure your funds arrive at the correct bank, no\nmatter where in the world you're sending money\nBreaking down a SWIFT code\nA SWIFT code contains 8-11 characters formatted like this: AAAA BB\nCC DDD\n\nAAAA \u2013 Bank code (4 letters identifying the bank)\nBB \u2013 Country code (2 letters identifying the country)\nCC \u2013 Location code (2 characters specifying the bank's city\nor region)\nDDD \u2013 Optional branch code (3 characters identifying the\nspecific branch)\nFor example, BOFAUS3N \u00b9 identifies Bank of America in New York,\nUSA.\nIBAN vs. SWIFT: Key differences\nKnowing when to use SWIFT codes versus IBANs can save you time\nand prevent transfer delays. While they both play crucial roles in\ninternational banking, they serve completely different functions in\ngetting your money where it needs to go.\nHere's how these two banking identifiers compare:\nFeature IBAN SWIFT\nSociety for Worldwide\nWhat It International Bank Account\nInterbank Financial\nStands For Number\nTelecommunication\nMain Identifies individual bank\nIdentifies banks globally\nPurpose accounts\nUsed for identifying specific Used for routing payments\nRole\naccounts internationally\nFormat Up to 34 characters 8-11 characters\n\nVaries by country, aligned with\nRegulatory\nISO (International Organization SWIFT organization\nBody\nfor Standardization) standards\nWhere It\u02bcs Mainly Europe, Middle East, and\nWorldwide\nUsed select regions\nWhich code should you use for your international\ntransfer?\nSo, how will you know whether you need a SWIFT code, an IBAN, or\nboth? The answer depends on where your money is headed. Getting\nit right the first time helps your transfer arrive faster and avoids\npotential processing delays.\nWhen to use each code\nSending to Europe, the Middle East, or the Caribbean? You'll\nlikely need an IBAN, and possibly a SWIFT code too\nSending to the USA, Canada, Australia, or Asia? A SWIFT\ncode is typically required\nSome countries require both SWIFT codes direct your money\nto the right bank, while the IBAN ensures it lands in the\ncorrect account\nReal-world transfer scenarios\nLet's break this down with some everyday examples:\n\nSending money to your sister studying in Germany? You'll\nneed her IBAN, and possibly her bank's SWIFT code too.\nEuropean banks rely heavily on IBANs for accurate account\nidentification.\nHelping your husband transfer funds to a business partner\nin Japan? You'll only need the recipient's SWIFT code, as\nJapan's banking system doesn't use IBANs.\nSupporting family in the UK? You'll need both codes - the\nSWIFT code routes your money to the right bank, while the\nIBAN ensures it reaches your family member's specific\naccount.\nNot sure what you need? Ask your recipient to check their\nbank statement or contact their bank directly. They can\nprovide exactly what's required for their country's banking\nsystem.\nEnsuring transfer success\nBefore hitting \"send\" on your international transfer, take a moment to\nverify all codes are correct. Even a single mistaken character can\nsend your money to the wrong destination or cause processing\ndelays.\nYou can find your own bank codes on your account statement or by\nlogging into your online banking portal.

      "reference_material_content": "Investor.gov\nU.S. SECURITIES AND\nEXCHANGE COMMISSION\nExchange-\nTraded Funds\n(ETFs)\nPlease note - this page discusses only ETFs that are\nregistered as open-end investment companies or\nunit investment trusts under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940. It does not address other\ntypes of exchange-traded products\n(/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/exchange-traded-products-etps)\n, such as exchange-traded commodity trusts or\nexchange-traded notes.\nWhat are ETFs?\nAn ETF is an exchange-traded investment product\nthat must register with the SEC as an open-end\n\ninvestment company or a unit investment trust.\nETFs pool money from many investors and invest\nthe money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-\nmarket instruments, other securities or assets, or\nsome combination of these investments. The\ncombined holdings the ETF owns are known as its\nportfolio, which is usually managed by an SEC-\nregistered investment adviser. Each ETF share\nrepresents an investor\u2019s part ownership of the ETF\u2019s\nportfolio and the income the portfolio generates.\nWhy do people buy ETFs?\nETFs are a popular choice among investors because\nthey generally offer the following features:\nProfessional Management. Most ETFs are\ntypically managed by investment advisers who\nare registered with the SEC.\nDiversification. Many ETFs invest in a range\nof companies and industries rather than\ninvesting in one specific stock or bond. This\nhelps to lower your risk if one company fails.\nHowever, some ETFs are less diverse than\nothers. They may have fewer investments or\nmay even track the performance of a single\nstock (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/glossary/single-stock-etfs) .\n\nLow Minimum Investment. ETF shares can\nbe purchased on the market often for\nrelatively low dollar amounts.\nLiquidity. ETF investors can trade their shares\non the market at the market price whenever\nthe market is open\u2014minus any fees.\nTax Advantage. Because many ETFs buy and\nsell portfolio securities in in-kind exchange\n(rather than for cash), they typically have\nfewer capital gains distributions \u2013 and thus\nlower taxes \u2013 than mutual funds.\nHow do I earn money from ETFs?\nInvestors can make money from their ETF\ninvestments in three ways:\nDividend Payments. A fund may earn income\nfrom its portfolio \u2013 for example, dividends on\nstock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays\nthe shareholders nearly all the income, less\nexpenses, as a dividend payment.\nCapital Gains Distributions. The price of the\nsecurities a fund owns may increase. When a\nfund sells a security that has increased in\nprice, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of\nthe year, the fund distributes these capital\ngains, minus any capital losses, to investors.\n\nIncreased Market Price. If the market value\nof an ETF\u2019s portfolio increases, after deduction\nof expenses and liabilities, then the net asset\nvalue (NAV)\n(https://www.investor.gov/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/net-asset-\nvalue) of the ETF increases, and the market\nprice of its shares may also increase.\nIf an ETF investor wants to reinvest a dividend\npayment or capital gains distribution, the process\ncan be more complicated than it is with mutual\nfunds. In addition, the investor may have to pay\nadditional brokerage commissions. Investors\nshould check with their ETF or investment\nprofessional.\nWhat are the risks of investing in ETFs?\nLike mutual funds, ETFs are not guaranteed or\ninsured by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. They therefore all carry some level of risk.\nYou may lose some or all of the money you invest\nbecause the securities held by a fund can go down\nin value. Dividends or interest payments may also\nchange as market conditions change.\nA fund\u2019s past performance is not as important as\nyou might think because past performance does\n\nnot predict future returns. But past performance\ncan tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been\nover a period of time. The more volatile the fund,\nthe higher the investment risk.\nDifferent funds have different risks and rewards\ndepending on their investment objectives.\nGenerally, the higher the potential return, the\nhigher the risk of loss.\nWhat do I pay for my ETF?\nAs with any business, running an ETF involves costs.\nFunds pass along these costs to investors by\ndeducting fees and expenses from NAV. That\nmeans you pay the fees and expenses indirectly.\nFees and expenses vary from fund to fund. It is\nimportant to understand what fees and expenses\nan ETF charges and how those fees and expenses\nimpact your investment. Even small differences in\nfees and expenses can mean large differences in\nreturns over time. In addition, a fund with high\ncosts must perform better than a low-cost fund to\ngenerate the same returns for you.\nRead Mutual Fund and ETF Fees and Expenses -\nInvestor Bulletin (/introduction-investing/general-\nresources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\n\nbulletins-20) to learn about some of the most\ncommon ETF fees and expenses. Also check out the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\nFund Analyzer (/financial-tools-\ncalculators/financial-tools/mutual-fund-analyzer) to\ncompute how the costs of different funds add up\nover time and eat into your returns.\nWhat are some common ETF investing strategies?\nIndex Funds. Index funds follow a passive\ninvestment strategy that is designed to\nachieve approximately the same return as a\nparticular index before fees. An index fund\nwill attempt to achieve its investment\nobjective primarily by investing in the\nsecurities of companies that are included in a\nselected index. Passive management usually\ntranslates into less trading of the fund\u2019s\nportfolio (fewer transaction costs), more\nfavorable income tax consequences (lower\nrealized capital gains), and lower fees than\nactively managed funds.\nActively Managed Funds. Actively managed\nfunds are not based on an index. Instead,\nthey seek to achieve a stated investment\nobjective by investing in a portfolio of stocks,\nbonds, and other assets. An adviser of an\nactively managed fund may actively buy or sell\n\ninvestments in the portfolio on a daily basis\nwithout regard to conformity with an index.\nBut the trades must be consistent with the\noverall investment objective and strategies of\nthe fund. An actively managed fund has the\npotential to outperform the market or its\nchosen benchmark, but its performance is\nheavily dependent on the skill of the manager.\nWhat types of ETFs are there?\nETFs fall into several main categories. Each type has\ndifferent features, risks, and rewards.\nStock funds (/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/stock-\nfund) invest primarily in stocks or equities. A\nstock is an instrument that represents an\nownership interest (called equity) in a\ncompany and a proportional share in the\ncompany\u2019s assets and profits. The types of\nstocks owned by a stock fund depend upon\nthe fund\u2019s investment objectives, policies, and\nstrategies. A stock fund\u2019s value can rise and\nfall quickly (and dramatically) over the short\nterm. The fund\u2019s performance depends, in\npart, on whether the underlying companies do\nwell or not.\n\nBond funds (/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/bond-\nfunds-and-income-funds) or income funds\ninvest primarily in bonds or other types of\ndebt securities. Depending on its investment\nobjectives and policies, a bond fund may\nconcentrate its investments in a particular\ntype of bond or debt security or a mixture of\ntypes. The securities that bond funds hold will\nvary in terms of risk, return, duration,\nvolatility and other features.\nTarget date funds (/news-alerts/investor-\nbulletins/target-date-retirement-funds)\ntypically hold a mix of stock funds, bond funds\nand other funds, and are created for\nindividuals with a particular date for\nretirement or other goal in mind. Target date\nfunds are designed to make investing for\nretirement or other goals more convenient by\nchanging their investment mix as the target\ndate gets closer. However, be aware that if a\ntarget date fund invests in other funds, it may\nhave a double layer of fees.\nMoney market fund ETFs (/introduction-\ninvesting/general-resources/news-\nalerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\nbulletins/updated-12) invest in liquid, short-\nterm debt securities, cash and cash\nequivalents."

The asset allocation decision is a personal\n\none. The allocation that works best for you changes\nat different times in your life, depending on how\nlong you have to invest and your ability to tolerate\nrisk.\nFactors to consider include your:\nTime Horizon. Your time horizon is the number of\nmonths, years, or decades you need to invest to\nachieve your financial goal. Investors with a longer\ntime horizon may feel comfortable taking on riskier\nor more volatile investments. Those with a shorter\ntime horizon may prefer to take on less risk.\nRisk Tolerance (/investing-basics/guiding-\nprinciples/assessing-your-risk-tolerance) . Risk\ntolerance is your ability and willingness to lose\nsome or all of your original investment in exchange\nfor potentially greater returns.\nWhat is diversification?\nWhat is rebalancing?\n()\n() What is diversification?\nThe practice of spreading money among different\ninvestments to reduce risk is known as\n\ndiversification. Diversification is a strategy that can\nbe neatly summed up as \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in\none basket.\u201d\nOne way to diversify is to allocate your investments\namong different kinds of assets. Historically, stocks,\nbonds, and cash have not moved up and down at\nthe same time. Factors that may cause one asset\nclass to perform poorly may improve returns for\nanother asset class. People invest in various asset\nclasses in the hope that if one is losing money, the\nothers make up for those losses.\nYou\u2019ll also be better diversified if you spread your\ninvestments within each asset class. That means\nholding a number of different stocks or bonds, and\ninvesting in different industry sectors, such as\nconsumer goods, health care, and technology. That\nway, if one sector is doing poorly, you may offset it\nwith other holdings in sectors that are doing well.\nSome investors find it easier to diversify by owning\nmutual funds. A mutual fund is a company that\npools money from many investors and invests the\nmoney in stocks, bonds, and other financial\nproducts. Mutual funds make it easy for investors\nto own a small portion of many investments. A total\nstock market index fund, for example, owns stock\n\nin thousands of companies, providing a lot of\ndiversification for one investment.\nA mutual fund won\u2019t necessarily provide\ndiversification, especially if it focuses on only one\nindustry sector. If you invest in narrowly focused\nmutual funds, you may need to invest in several to\nbe diversified. As you add more investments to\nyour portfolio, you\u2019ll likely pay additional fees and\nexpenses, which will lower your investment\nreturns. So you\u2019ll need to consider these costs when\ndeciding the best way to diversify your portfolio.\n() What is rebalancing?\nRebalancing is what investors do to bring their\nportfolio back to its original asset allocation mix.\nRebalancing is needed because over time, some\ninvestments will grow faster than others. This may\npush your holdings out of alignment with your\ninvestment goals. By rebalancing, you will ensure\nthat your portfolio does not overweight a particular\nasset category, and you\u2019ll return your portfolio to a\ncomfortable level of risk.\nFor example, you might start with 60% of your\nportfolio invested in stocks, but see that rise to 80%\ndue to market gains. To reestablish your original\n\nasset allocation mix, you\u2019ll either need to sell some\nof your stocks or invest in other asset categories.\nThere are three ways you can rebalance your\nportfolio:\n1. You can sell investments where your holdings\nare over weighted and use the proceeds to\nbuy investments for underweighted asset\ncategories.\n2. You can buy new investments for\nunderweighted asset categories.\n3. If you are continuing to add to your\ninvestments, you can alter your contributions\nso that more goes to underweighted asset\ncategories until your portfolio is back into\nbalance.\nBefore you rebalance your portfolio, you should\nconsider whether the method of rebalancing you\ndecide to use would entail transaction fees or tax\nconsequences. Your financial professional or tax\nadviser can help you identify ways that you can\nminimize these potential costs.\nSome financial experts advise rebalancing at\nregular intervals, such as every six or 12 months.\nOthers recommend rebalancing when your\nholdings of an asset class increase or decrease\n\nmore than a certain pre-set percentage. In either\ncase, rebalancing tends to work best when done on\na relatively infrequent basis.\nShifting money away from an asset class when it is\ndoing well in favor of an asset category that is\ndoing poorly may not be easy. But it can be a wise\nmove. By cutting back on current \u201cwinners\u201d and\nadding more current \u201closers,\u201d rebalancing forces\nyou to buy low and sell high."

Making your money work for you\nmeans you use your money to make more money. One\n\nway to do that is by earning interest on the money you\nalready have.\nWhat exactly is interest?\nWhen you deposit money in a savings account at a\nbank, the money you deposit is called principal. The\nmoney you earn on your principal is called interest. You\nget to keep the interest. This is money the bank pays\nyou to keep your money with them. Interest is earned\nafter a period of time, like each month. Compound\ninterest is what you earn on your principal after the\nfirst month that helps your money grow.\nWhat is compound interest?\nYou deposited your principal in the bank and earned\ninterest; they are added together to become your new\nprincipal. The next time you earn interest, you earn\ninterest on your new principal. Every time you earn\ninterest, it is added to your principal. Earning money on\nyour principal and interest over and over again is\ncompound interest. The longer your money is in a\nsavings account, the more you earn. In addition,\ndifferent banks offer different interest rates; the higher\nthe interest rate, the faster your money will grow.\n\nNoah saved $100 from his allowance and birthday\nmoney. At the beginning of July, he deposited that\nmoney into a savings account at a local FDIC-insured\nbank. The bank pays 3 percent (3 percent = .03) interest\ncompounded monthly. With only his $100 deposit and\ncompounding interest, how much will Noah have in his\naccount by the end of the year?\nLet\u2019s figure it out. Multiply Noah\u2019s $100 principal by 3\npercent interest. So, $100 x .03 equals $3 in interest.\nAdd the $100 and $3 to get Noah\u2019s new principal of\n$103. At the end of the July, Noah will have $103 in his\nsavings account. For August, Noah\u2019s principal is $103.\nMultiply by 3 percent ($103 x .03) to figure out his\ncompounding interest, which is $3.09. Add that to $103\nand his new balance for August with interest is $106.09.\nYou can see in the table below that Noah\u2019s $100\ndeposit from July with 3 percent compounding interest\nhas now earned $19.41.

The\nstandard FDIC insurance amount is $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank, for each account\nownership category. However, depositors benefit\nfrom other consumer protections as well.\nBelow is some information about the most common\ndeposit accounts, the consumer protections\nprovided for those accounts, and other information.\nDeposit Account Basics\nOther Services Deposit Accounts May Offer\nConsumer Protections on Deposit Accounts\nBilling Error and Resolution Basics\nAdditional Resources\nDeposit Account Basics\nDeposit products include savings accounts, checking\naccounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money\nmarket accounts.\n\nchecking account\nA is a transactional account. It is\ndesigned for individuals to deposit money into it and\ntake money out of it frequently. People usually use\nchecking accounts to keep their money available for\npaying bills and withdrawing money for regular use.\nMoney in a checking account may earn interest.\nsavings account\nA is used to set aside money for the\nfuture. People usually use savings accounts to\ndeposit money they do not expect to need or use on\na regular basis.\nCD\nA is another type of account consumers can use\nto set aside money for the future. Unlike a savings\naccount, you cannot withdraw funds from a CD\nwhenever you like. Typically, you must keep money\nin a CD for a certain period of time or you will likely\nhave to pay a penalty or lose some or all of the\ninterest you earned. The required period of time\ncould be three months to five years or more. In\naddition, there may be a required minimum deposit.\nCDs typically offer a higher rate of interest than\nregular savings accounts.\n\nmoney market\nSome financial institutions offer\naccounts\n(also known as money market deposit\naccounts or money market savings accounts) to\nconsumers. These accounts usually pay a higher rate\nof interest and require a higher minimum balance\nthan some other account options. Unlike CDs, there\nis no requirement that you keep your money in the\naccount for a designated period of time.\nBack to top\nOther Services Deposit Accounts\nMay Offer\nTypically, banks offer a number of services with their\ndeposit accounts. Depending on the institution,\nthese may include:\nCheck cashing \u2013 This is converting a check to cash.\nYou will generally not have to pay a fee to cash a\ncheck at a financial institution where you have an\naccount.\n\nDirect deposit - With both checking and savings\naccounts, direct deposit allows your money to be\nsafely and securely electronically deposited into your\naccount.\nMoney orders \u2013 Money orders can be used to send\nmoney to individuals or businesses. With a money\norder, you provide the amount of money you want\nto pay plus a fee to a bank, store, or the U.S. Postal\nService. They then give you a piece of paper (the\nmoney order) that may look like a check that you can\nuse to send the money. You do not need an account\nat a financial institution to purchase a money order.\nSome businesses require consumers to pay with a\nmoney orders because it is consider a safer form of\npayment than a personal check because the funds\nhave already been provided in order to purchase the\nmoney order. There\u2019s no chance of a money order\n\u201cbouncing\u201d. Using a money order also keeps a\nconsumer from having to worry about overdraft or\nnon-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. In addition, money\norders are usually easy to replace if they\u2019re lost or\nstolen.\n\nCashier\u2019s checks \u2013 These are checks that are\nguaranteed by a financial institution. When you\npurchase a cashier\u2019s check, the bank takes the\nmoney from your checking or savings account and\nputs it in its own account. The bank then writes out a\ncheck to the person or business you need to pay.\nLike a money order, a cashier\u2019s check is considered a\nsafer form of payment than a personal check -- in\nthis case, because the check is guaranteed by the\nfinancial institution. Again, the check is guaranteed\nnot to bounce. And, again, a cashier\u2019s check can be\nreplaced if it is lost or stolen.\nPrepaid cards \u2013 With prepaid cards, you are\nspending funds that have been deposited onto\nthem. They usually aren\u2019t linked to your checking or\nsavings account. Instead, funds are loaded onto a\ncard you can use to make purchases and get cash.\nEach time the card is used, the balance on the card\nis reduced by the amount spent. Sometimes there\nare fees associated with using a prepaid card.\nDebit cards \u2013 With debit cards, you are spending\nfunds that are in your checking or savings account.\nEach time you use the card, the balance in your\n\naccount is reduced by the amount spent, as well as\nany associated fees. Debit cards can be used at\nautomated teller machines (ATMs). They can also be\nused for purchases, both online and at \u201cpoint of\npurchase\u201d (e.g., stores, restaurants, or gas stations).\nAutomated teller machines (ATMs) \u2013 These machines\ncan process a variety of banking transactions,\nincluding accepting deposits and loan payments,\nproviding cash for withdrawals, and transferring\nmoney between accounts.\nATM cards \u2013 ATM cards allow you to use an ATM for\nvarious account transactions. Certain ATM cards can\nalso be used to make purchases.\nOnline or mobile banking, including bill-paying\nservices \u2013 This refers to managing your accounts\nusing the internet on a computer or mobile device.\nDepending on the bank, there may be a number of\nservices accessible online or through an app:\nView up-to-date information on your account\nbalance to help reconcile your accounts on a more\nfrequent basis.\n\nSet up automatic payments from your account to\npay your bills.\nReceive alerts when you have a new bill to pay from\nsome companies, such as utilities.\nDeposit checks remotely, in some cases, by taking a\npicture of the front and back of the check you want\nto deposit.\n\u201cPerson-to-person\u201d payments (P2P) \u2013 This refers to\nmobile apps or other web-based services that allow\nperson-to-person money transfers. Typically, users\nlink the mobile payment system to their bank\naccounts or credit card accounts and initiate\ntransfers of funds to others who are also users of\nthe same app or web-based service.\nThere are several mobile person-to-person payment\napps and they differ in how they work. One may let\nyou transfer money after logging into a website.\nAnother may let you transfer money by physically\ntouching your phone to another person\u2019s phone.\nRemittance transfers \u2013 These transfers are used to\nmove money to a person or business in another\ncountry. They may also be referred to as\n\n\u201cinternational wires,\u201d \u201cinternational money\ntransfers,\u201d or \u201cremittances.\u201d\nBack to top"

      "reference_material_content": "Investor.gov\nU.S. SECURITIES AND\nEXCHANGE COMMISSION\nAn Introduction to 529 Plans -\nInvestor Bulletin\nJan. 28, 2026\nThe SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and\nAssistance is issuing this Investor Bulletin to\nprovide investors with background information on\n529 plans. Please also see our companion Bulletin\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-\nbulletin-10-questions-consider-before) for a few\nquestions to consider before opening a 529 plan\naccount.\nWhat is a 529 plan?\nA 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan\ndesigned to encourage saving for future education\ncosts. 529 plans, legally known as \u201cqualified tuition\nplans,\u201d are sponsored by states, state agencies, or\neducational institutions and are authorized by\nSection 529 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThere are two types of 529 plans: education savings\nplans and prepaid tuition plans. Most education\nsavings plans are available to everyone, but a few\nhave residency requirements for the saver and/or\nbeneficiary. Prepaid tuition plans typically have\nresidency requirements. One exception is a prepaid\ntuition plan sponsored by a group of private\ncolleges and universities.\nThe person who opens the 529 plan account is\ncalled the account holder or the saver. The person\nthe account is opened for is called\nthe beneficiary or the student. The account holder\nand the beneficiary can be the same person.\nWhat are the differences between education\nsavings plans and prepaid tuition plans?\nEducation Savings Plans. Education savings plans\nlet a saver open an investment account to save for\nthe beneficiary\u2019s future qualified higher education\nexpenses (https://www.investor.gov/introduction-\ninvesting/investing-basics/glossary/qualified-\nhigher-education-expenses) . Qualified higher\neducation expenses include tuition and certain\nexpenses for post-secondary education and\nrecognized post-secondary credential programs.\nWithdrawals from education savings plan accounts\ncan generally be used at any college or university,\n\nincluding sometimes at non-U.S. colleges and\nuniversities, or at a recognized post-secondary\ncredential program. Education savings plans can\nalso be used to pay for other education-related\nexpenses. These include up to $20,000 per year per\nbeneficiary for tuition and certain expenses at any\npublic, private, or religious elementary or\nsecondary school; certain expenses required for\nparticipation in registered apprenticeship\nprograms; and qualified education loan\nrepayments up to $10,000 total per beneficiary.\nA saver may typically choose among a range of\ninvestment options, which often include\nvarious mutual fund\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/mutual-\nfunds) and exchange-traded fund\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/exchange-\ntraded-fund-etf) (ETF) investments and a principal-\nprotected bank product. Education savings plans\nalso may include static fund portfolios and age-\nbased portfolios (sometimes called target-date\n(https://www.investor.gov/additional-\nresources/general-resources/glossary/target-date-\nfund) portfolios). These portfolios include a\ncombination of different types of ETFs and/or\nmutual funds and are designed to help diversify the\n\nrisk in the account. Typically age-based portfolios\nautomatically shift funds into more conservative\ninvestments as the beneficiary gets closer to\ncollege age, but static fund portfolios will keep the\nsame mix of investments. If you are using a 529\naccount to pay for elementary or secondary school\ntuition, you may have a shorter time horizon for\nyour money to grow. You may not feel comfortable\ntaking on riskier or more volatile investments if you\nplan on withdrawing the money soon. Therefore,\nyou may consider different investment options\ndepending on when you plan to use the money that\nis invested.\nAll education savings plans are sponsored by state\ngovernments, but only a few have residency\nrequirements for the saver and/or beneficiary.\nState governments do not guarantee investments\nin education savings plans. Education savings plan\ninvestments in mutual funds and ETFs are not\nfederally guaranteed, but investments in some\nprincipal-protected bank products may be insured\nby the FDIC. As with most investments, you can lose\nmoney in an education savings plan.\nPrepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans let a\nsaver or account holder purchase units or credits\nfor the beneficiary to use in the future at\nparticipating colleges and universities. The saver is\n\nessentially pre-paying future tuition and\nmandatory fees at the current prices of tuition and\nmandatory fees. The participating colleges and\nuniversities are typically public, in-state institutions\nin the state that sponsors the plan. Prepaid tuition\nplans are not as flexible as education savings plans\nbecause the credits can only be used for future\ntuition and mandatory fees at certain schools. If\nthe beneficiary does not attend a participating\ncollege or university, they can typically still receive\nmoney from the plan to help pay for college tuition\nand mandatory fees, but the amount is determined\nby the particular plan.\nMost prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by state\ngovernments and have residency requirements for\nthe saver and/or beneficiary. Prepaid plans are not\nguaranteed by the federal government. Some state\ngovernments guarantee the money paid into the\nprepaid tuition plans that they sponsor, but some\ndo not. If your prepaid tuition payments aren\u2019t\nguaranteed, you may lose some or all of your\nmoney in the plan if the plan\u2019s sponsor has a\nfinancial shortfall. In addition, if a beneficiary\ndoesn\u2019t attend a participating college or university,\nthe prepaid tuition plan may pay less than if the\nbeneficiary attended a participating college or\nuniversity. It may only pay a small return on the\n\noriginal investment, depending on how the plan\ncalculates your return.\nWhat fees and expenses will I pay if I invest in a\n529 plan?\nIt is important to understand the fees and\nexpenses associated with 529 plans because they\nlower your returns. Fees and expenses will vary\nbased on the type of 529 plan (education savings\nplan or prepaid tuition plan), whether it is a broker-\nor direct-sold plan, the plan itself and the\nunderlying investments. You should carefully\nreview the plan\u2019s offering circular to understand\nwhat fees are charged for the plan and each\ninvestment option.\nEducation Savings Plans. Education savings plans\nmay charge an enrollment/application fee, annual\naccount maintenance fees, ongoing program\nmanagement fees, and ongoing asset management\nfees. The asset management fees will depend on\nthe investment option you select. Investors that\npurchase an education savings plan from a broker\nare typically subject to additional fees, such as\nsales loads or charges at the time of investment or\nredemption and ongoing distribution fees.\n\nPrepaid Tuition Plans. Prepaid tuition plans may\ncharge an enrollment/application fee and ongoing\nadministrative fees.\n\nWhat restrictions apply to an investment in a\n529 plan?\nThere will likely be restrictions on any 529 plan you\nmay be considering. Before you invest in a 529 plan,\nyou should read the plan\u2019s offering circular to make\n\nsure that you understand and are comfortable with\nany plan restrictions.\nInvestments. Education savings plans have certain\npre-set investment options. It is not permitted to\nswitch freely among the options.

We encourage you to\nalso consult Internal Revenue Service\n(https://www.irs.gov/) (IRS) guidance on HSAs.\nWhat is a health savings account\n(HSA)?\nA health savings account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged\nsavings account you can use to pay for qualified\nmedical expenses. Qualified medical expenses can\ninclude, for example, doctor and hospital bills,\nprescription medicine, and dental and vision costs.\nHSAs come with federal and sometimes state tax\nbenefits, which means using an HSA instead of a\n\ntraditional checking or savings account to pay for\nqualified medical expenses\n(https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-\npublication-502) can help you save money.\nYou can put money in an HSA like you would a\ntypical deposit account. Some HSAs also allow you\nto invest your money, including in securities like\nmutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You\ncan use HSA money to pay for both current and\nfuture medical expenses.\nHSAs can be used for spending, saving, and\ninvesting. An HSA can be used as a spending\naccount for current medical expenses, a savings\naccount for unexpected medical costs, and an\ninvestment account to grow your assets for medical\nexpenses in the future, like during retirement.\nHow does an HSA work?\nRequires a high-deductible health insurance\nplan (HDHP). By law, you can only contribute\nmoney to an HSA if you participate in an HDHP.\nHSAs are often offered as part of employer-\nsponsored HDHPs. You can use HSA money to pay\nfor qualified medical expenses not covered by your\nHDHP.\n\nContributions. You can deposit money into your\nHSA like you would a regular savings account. If\nyour HSA is set up through your employer, you\nmight have the option to contribute through\npayroll deductions. Your employer can also choose\nto contribute. The IRS sets limits on total annual\ncontributions.\nNo \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d Any unused balance in your\nHSA is generally carried over year after year. There\nis no deadline to use your HSA balance, including if\nyou stop participating in an HDHP.\nReimbursement. If you pay for a qualified medical\nexpense out of pocket, you can reimburse yourself\nfor that expense using your HSA money\u2014 as long\nas the expense was incurred after you established\nthe HSA. State law determines when an HSA is\nestablished.\nWhat about investing HSA savings?\nOpportunity to invest. Some, but not all, HSAs\nallow you to invest some or all of your HSA balance.\nIn some cases, a minimum account balance may\napply before you are eligible to make investments.\nIf you plan to use your HSA for future healthcare\ncosts, you might consider investing some or all of\n\nyour HSA savings. The longer your money is\ninvested, the more opportunity it has to grow.\nInvestment choices. The investment options\noffered by HSAs may vary widely. Some HSAs offer\nseveral investment products, while others may\noffer only a few options. Examples of potential\ninvestment options include mutual funds\n(/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-\nexchange-traded-funds-etfs/mutual-funds) and\nETFs (/introduction-investing/investing-\nbasics/investment-products/mutual-funds-and-\nexchange-traded-2) .\nFees. If you invest your money, you may pay\nadditional fees. These additional fees typically\ninclude underlying fund fees and transaction fees\nin addition to any HSA account maintenance fees.\nOther fees may apply as well. Over time, fees can\nimpact the performance of your investment\nportfolio. Be sure you understand the total cost of\nyour HSA and any investments you choose to make.\nWhat are the federal tax benefits of\nusing an HSA?\nHSAs provide a triple tax advantage.\n\nContributions. When you contribute money to\nyour HSA through payroll deductions, you are\ncontributing pre-tax dollars. For other\ncontributions, you can claim a tax deduction\nthat reduces your federal taxable income.\nEarnings. Any earnings in your HSA (such as\nfrom interest or investment gains) are not\nsubject to federal tax while they remain in your\nHSA.\nWithdrawals. HSA withdrawals for qualified\nmedical expenses are not subject to federal\ntax.\nSome, but not all, states offer tax benefits for HSAs.\nIn addition, state and federal laws that affect HSAs\ncould change. You should make sure you\nunderstand the tax implications of using an HSA\nand consider whether to consult a tax adviser.\nHow can I open an HSA?\nYou can open an HSA with the financial institution\nof your choice, as long as you are eligible to open\nand contribute to an HSA. Consult IRS guidelines to\ndetermine if you are eligible\n(https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4885.pdf) .\n\nBanks, credit unions, and other financial\ninstitutions offer HSAs.\nIf your employer offers an HDHP, they might also\noffer you the option of opening an HSA. Some\nemployers may only offer employer contributions\nand direct payroll deductions into an HSA with a\ncertain provider. However, other HSA options\nmay be available to you. Don\u2019t be afraid to shop\naround for the HSA that suits you best.\nBe sure you understand any restrictions and fees\nthat apply before opening an HSA. This will help\nyou make the most of your HSA.\nWhat are some other features of\nHSAs?\nEase of access. Some HSAs allow you to pay for\nqualifying expenses directly using a linked debit\ncard or online bill payment system. Others may\nrequire you to pay for eligible expenses out of your\nown pocket and request reimbursement from your\nHSA.\nAccount maintenance fees. Some HSAs charge a\nmonthly account maintenance fee. Other HSAs may\nhave no account maintenance fee or may waive the\nfee if your account has a sufficiently high balance.\n\nInterest. Some HSAs pay interest on money you\ndon\u2019t spend immediately or invest.\nWhat happens if I use my HSA for\nnon-medical expenses?\nThe answer depends on your age.\nBefore age 65. HSA dollars are subject to federal\nincome taxes and a federal tax penalty if used on\nany non-medical expenses before age 65.\nAge 65 and beyond. After you turn 65, you can use\nthe money in your HSA for anything without paying\nthe penalty. However, you will still have to pay\nfederal income taxes on the money if you don\u2019t use\nit for qualified medical expenses.\nCan I move my existing HSA?\nIf you already have an HSA, such as through your\nemployer, you are allowed to move your HSA assets\n(cash and/or investments) to an HSA with a\ndifferent provider. For example, you might consider\nmoving your HSA assets to a provider with\ninvestment options that better fit your financial\ngoals.\nIf you have multiple HSAs, such as from different\nemployers over the years, you might consider\n\nconsolidating them into one HSA for ease of\nmanagement.\nIf you have an HSA through your employer and you\nchange jobs or retire, you can take your HSA with\nyou (keeping it with the existing HSA provider or\nmoving it to a different one).\nMoving your HSA assets can be done by transfer or\nrollover. Transfers and rollovers are very specific\nprocesses. Before you transfer or roll over money\nfrom one HSA to another, make sure you\nunderstand the rules around doing so and any tax\nconsequences. Consider whether to consult your\nHSA provider, IRS guidance,\nyour state\u2019s tax law and/or a tax professional."
