      "reference_material_content": "Carpal tunnel syndrome\nOverview\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions. It is caused by pressure\non the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway\nsurrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. When the median nerve is\ncompressed, symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the thumb and\nfingers.\nWrist anatomy, health conditions and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal\ntunnel syndrome.\nProper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores hand function.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include:\nTingling and numbness. Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. Usually\nthe thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. You might\nhave a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. These symptoms often occur while\nholding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep.\nThe sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm.\nMany people \"shake out\" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may\nbecome constant over time.\nWeakness. People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and\ndrop objects. This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching\nmuscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that interfere\nwith your usual activities and sleep patterns. Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur\nwithout treatment.\nCauses\nk\nc\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. b a\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nThe median nerve runs from the forearm through a passageway in the wrist to the hand, known\nas the carpal tunnel. The median nerve provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and all\nof the fingers except the little finger. This nerve also provides signals to move the muscles\naround the base of the thumb. This movement is known as motor function.\nAnything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. This\nalso may occur due to swelling and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis or other\ndiseases.\nMany times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Or the cause may not be\nknown. It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the\ncondition.\nRisk factors\nSeveral factors have been linked with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although they may not directly\ncause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median\nnerve. These include:\nAnatomical factors. A wrist fracture or dislocation can alter the space within the carpal\ntunnel. Arthritis that causes changes to the small bones in the wrist can affect the carpal\ntunnel. These changes can put pressure on the median nerve.\nPeople who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSex assigned at birth. Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This\nmay be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men. Or it may\nbe due to the effect of hormones on the lining of the tendons in the carpal tunnel.\nWomen who have carpal tunnel syndrome also may have smaller carpal tunnels than do\nwomen who don't have the condition.\nNerve-damaging conditions. Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk\nof nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve.\nInflammatory conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and other conditions that cause\nswelling, known as inflammation, can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist. This\ncan put pressure on the median nerve.\nMedicines. Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and\nanastrozole (Arimidex), a medicine used to treat breast cancer.\nObesity. Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nBody fluid changes. Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel,\nirritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal\ntunnel syndrome that happens with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after\npregnancy.\nOther medical conditions. Certain conditions, such as thyroid disorders, kidney failure and\nlymphedema, may increase the chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome.\nk\nWorkplace factors. Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires a c\nb\nd\ne\nrepeated movements that flex the wrist may create pressure on the median nerve. Suche\nF\n\nwork also may worsen existing nerve damage. Pressure on the nerve can be worse if the\nwork is done in a cold environment.\nHowever, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as\ndirect causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSeveral studies have evaluated whether there is a link between computer use and carpal\ntunnel syndrome. Some evidence suggests that mouse use, but not the use of a keyboard,\nmay be related to carpal tunnel syndrome. There has not been enough quality and\nconsistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel\nsyndrome. However, computer use may cause a different form of hand pain.\nPrevention\nThere are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can lessen stress on\nthe hands and wrists with these methods:\nReduce your force and relax your grip. If your work involves a cash register or keyboard,\nfor instance, hit the keys softly.\nTake short, frequent breaks. Gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically.\nAlternate tasks when possible. This is especially important if you use equipment that\nvibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force. Taking a break for even a few\nminutes each hour can make a difference.\nWatch your form. Do not bend your wrist all the way up or down when using a keyboard. A\nrelaxed middle position with the wrists parallel to the floor is best. Keep your keyboard at\nelbow height or slightly lower.\nImprove your posture. The wrong posture can occur when you adjust your body to view a\ncomputer screen rather than adjusting the screen height and distance to a correct posture.\nThe wrong posture rolls shoulders forward, shortens the neck and shoulder muscles, and\ncompresses nerves in the neck. This can cause neck pain and also may bother the hands\nand arms.\nChange your computer mouse. Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable to\nuse and doesn't strain your wrist.\nKeep your hands warm. You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in\na cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that\nkeep the hands and wrists warm.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Peripheral neuropathy\nOverview\nPeripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves that are located outside of the brain and spinal\ncord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. This condition often causes weakness, numbness and\npain, usually in the hands and feet. It also can affect other areas and body functions including\ndigestion and urination.\nThe peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the\ncentral nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. The peripheral nerves\nalso send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves.\nPeripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems,\ninherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is\ndiabetes.\nPeople with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling.\nSometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated.\nMedicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.\nSymptoms\nEvery nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of\nnerves affected. Nerves are divided into:\nSensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from\nthe skin.\nMotor nerves that control muscle movement.\nAutonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate,\ndigestion and bladder function.\nSymptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include:\nGradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations\ncan spread upward into your legs and arms.\nSharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain.\nExtreme sensitivity to touch.\nPain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting\nk\nc\na\nweight on them or when they're under a blanket. b\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nLack of coordination and falling.\nMuscle weakness.\nFeeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not.\nInability to move if motor nerves are affected.\nIf autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include:\nHeat intolerance.\nExcessive sweating or not being able to sweat.\nBowel, bladder or digestive problems.\nDrops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.\nPeripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more\nnerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's\ncalled polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people\nwith peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek medical care right away if you notice unusual tingling, weakness, or pain in your hands or\nfeet. Early diagnosis and treatment give you the best chance for controlling your symptoms and\npreventing further damage to your peripheral nerves.\nCauses\nPeripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by several different conditions. Health\nconditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include:\nAutoimmune diseases. These include Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,\nGuillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitis.\nAlso, some cancers related to the body's immune system can cause polyneuropathy. These\nare a form of autoimmune disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome.\nDiabetes and metabolic syndrome. This is the most common cause. Among people with\ndiabetes, more than half will develop some type of neuropathy.\nInfections. These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease,\nshingles, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV.\nInherited disorders. Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types\nof neuropathy that run in families.\nTumors. Cancerous growths, also called malignant, and noncancerous growths, also called\nbenign, can grow on or press on nerves.\nBone marrow disorders. These include a protein in the blood that isn't usually there, called\nmonoclonal gammopathies, a rare form of myeloma that affects the bones, lymphoma and\nthe rare disease amyloidosis.\nOther diseases. These include metabolic conditions such as kidney disease or liver\ndisease, and an underactive thyroid, also known as hypothyroidism. k\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\nOther causes of neuropathies include: e\nF\n\nAlcohol use disorder. Unhealthy dietary choices made by people with alcohol use disorder,\nalso known as alcoholism, and poor absorption of vitamins can lead to low amounts of\nessential vitamins in the body.\nExposure to poisons. Toxic substances include industrial chemicals and heavy metals\nsuch as lead and mercury.\nMedicines. Certain medicines, especially chemotherapy used to treat cancer, can cause\nperipheral neuropathy.\nInjury or pressure on the nerve. Injuries, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or\nsports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can result from\nhaving a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times.\nLow vitamin levels. B vitamins, including B-1, B-6 and B-12, as well as copper and vitamin\nE are crucial to nerve health.\nIn some cases, no cause can be identified. This is called idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.\nRisk factors\nPeripheral neuropathy risk factors include:\nDiabetes, especially if your sugar levels are not controlled well.\nAlcohol misuse.\nLow levels of vitamins in the body, especially vitamin B-12.\nInfections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, hepatitis B and C, and HIV.\nAutoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system\nattacks your own tissues.\nKidney, liver or thyroid disorders.\nExposure to toxins.\nRepetitive motion, such as those performed for certain jobs.\nFamily history of neuropathy.\nComplications\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy can include:\nBurns, skin injuries and wounds on the feet. You might not feel temperature changes or\npain on parts of your body that are numb.\nInfection. Your feet and other areas that lack sensation can become injured without your\nknowing. Check these areas regularly, wear close-toed, well-fitting shoes and treat minor\ninjuries before they become infected, especially if you have diabetes.\nFalls. Weakness and loss of sensation may be associated with lack of balance and falling.\nInstalling handrails in the bathroom, using canes or walkers when needed, and ensuring that\nyou are walking only in well-lit rooms can decrease fall risk.\nPrevention k\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nManage underlying conditions\nThe best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to manage medical conditions that put you at\nrisk.\nMake healthy lifestyle choices\nThese habits support your nerve health:\nEat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein to keep nerves\nhealthy. Protect against low levels of vitamin B-12 by eating meats, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy\nfoods and fortified cereals. If you're vegetarian or vegan, fortified cereals are a good source\nof vitamin B-12, but talk to your health care professional about B-12 supplements.\nExercise regularly. With a health care professional's OK, try to get at least 30 minutes to\none hour of exercise at least three times a week.\nAvoid factors that may cause nerve damage. These factors can include repetitive\nmotions, exposure to toxic chemicals, smoking and drinking too much alcohol.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

      "reference_material_content": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\n(BPPV)\nOverview\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also called BPPV, is one of the most common causes of\nvertigo. Vertigo is the sudden feeling of spinning or moving.\nBPPV causes brief periods of mild to intense dizziness. Certain changes in the head's position\nmost often set them off. This might happen from tipping the head up or down, lying down, or\nturning over or sitting up in bed.\nAlthough BPPV can be a bother, it's rarely serious. But it can raise the chance of falling. A\nhealthcare professional can treat BPPV during an office visit.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, also called BPPV, may include:\nDizziness.\nA sense of spinning or moving or that the area around you is spinning or moving. This is\ncalled vertigo.\nA loss of balance or not being steady.\nStomach upset and vomiting.\nThe symptoms of BPPV can come and go. Symptoms most often last less than a minute. Bouts\nof BPPV can go away for some time and then come back.\nWhat type of head movement brings on BPPV varies from person to person. But a change in\nhead position almost always is what brings on the symptoms. Some people also feel off balance\nwhen standing or walking.\nAtypical rhythmic eye movements, called nystagmus, most often go with the symptoms of\nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have dizziness or vertigo that is sudden, intense, lasts\nlong or keeps coming back.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\nSeek emergency care e\ne\nF\n\nIt's not common for BPPV to signal a serious illness. But see your healthcare professional right\naway if you have dizziness or vertigo with any of the following:\nA new, different or bad headache.\nA fever.\nSeeing double or not being able to see well.\nHearing loss.\nTrouble talking.\nWeakness in the leg or arm.\nPassing out.\nFalling or trouble walking.\nNumbness or tingling.\nCauses\nOften, there's no known cause for BPPV. This is called idiopathic BPPV.\nWhen there is a known cause, BPPV may be linked with a blow to the head. Less common\ncauses of BPPV include conditions that damage the inner ear.\nRarely, the cause can be damage that happens during ear surgery. Or the symptoms can result\nfrom being on your back for a time, such as during surgery or bed rest.\nThe ear's role\nInside the ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth. It includes three loop-shaped\nstructures called semicircular canals. They have fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that detect the\nhead's movement.\nOther structures in the ear, called otolith organs, detect the head's movements up and down,\nright and left, back and forth. The otolith organs hold crystals that respond to gravity.\nFor many reasons, these crystals can move out of place. When the crystals move, they can go\ninto one of the semicircular canals. Certain head movements can cause the crystals to move.\nWhen the crystals move, they cause the semicircular canal to become sensitive to certain head\nposition changes. This is what causes the dizziness.\nRisk factors\nThe risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is higher in people age 50 and older. But it can\nhappen at any age. The condition is more common in people assigned female at birth.\nA head injury or any other condition of the balance organs of the ear may raise the risk of BPPV.\nThe bone-thinning condition osteoporosis also might be a risk factor.\nComplications\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nBPPV rarely causes complications.

      "reference_material_content": "Thoracic outlet syndrome\nOverview\nThoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions in which there's pressure on blood\nvessels or nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. This space is known as the\nthoracic outlet. Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck\npain. It also can cause numbness in the fingers.\nCommon causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include trauma from a car accident, repetitive\ninjuries from a job or sport, and pregnancy. Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or\nirregular rib, also can cause TOS. Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not\nknown.\nTreatment often involves physical therapy and pain relief. Most people improve with these\ntreatments. For some, surgery may be recommended.\nSymptoms\nThere are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome:\nNeurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the most common type of thoracic outlet\nsyndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The\nnerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle\nmovements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand.\nVenous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one\nor more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in\nblood clots.\nArterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when\none of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury\nto the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation.\nThoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are\ncompressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:\nNumbness or tingling in the arm or fingers.\nPain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand.\nArm fatigue with activity.\nA weakening grip. c k\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nSymptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: F\n\nA change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers.\nHand or arm pain and swelling.\nSymptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\nA pulsating lump near the collarbone.\nCold fingers, hands or arms.\nHand and arm pain.\nA change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand.\nWeak or no pulse in the affected arm.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you regularly experience any of the symptoms of thoracic\noutlet syndrome.\nCauses\nThoracic outlet syndrome is often caused by compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the\nthoracic outlet, the area between the neck and shoulder. The cause of the compression varies\nand can include:\nDifferences in anatomy. Some people are born with an extra rib in the neck found above\nthe first rib. The extra rib, known as a cervical rib, can compress nerves or blood vessels.\nThere also may be a tight fibrous band connecting the spine to the rib that causes\ncompression.\nPoor posture. Drooping your shoulders or holding your head in a forward position can\ncause compression in the thoracic outlet area.\nTrauma. A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then\ncompress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic\naccident often is delayed.\nRisk factors\nThere are several factors that seem to increase the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome, including:\nSex. Women are more than three times more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic outlet\nsyndrome than are men.\nAge. Thoracic outlet syndrome may occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in\nadults between the ages of 20 and 50.\nComplications\nComplications from this condition stem from the type of thoracic outlet syndrome. If you have\nswelling or a painful discoloration in the arm, it is important to seek urgent medical attention.\nYou may need treatment for blood clots or an aneurysm.\nk\nc\na\nb\nd\ne\ne\nF\n\nFor neurogenic TOS, repetitive nerve compression can result in long-term injury resulting in\nchronic pain or disability. Neurogenic TOS can be confused for other joint or muscle injuries. If\nsymptoms don't improve, it is important to seek medical attention for an evaluation and testing.\nPrevention\nIf you're at risk of thoracic outlet compression, avoid repetitive movements and lifting heavy\nobjects. If you're overweight, losing weight may help you prevent or relieve symptoms of\nthoracic outlet syndrome.\nEven if you don't have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, avoid carrying heavy bags over\nyour shoulder. This can increase pressure on the thoracic outlet. Stretch daily, and do exercises\nthat keep your shoulder muscles strong and flexible.\nDaily stretches focusing on the chest, neck and shoulders can help improve shoulder muscle\nstrength and prevent thoracic outlet syndrome.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

This amyloid buildup can affect the way organs work.\nAmyloidosis may affect the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system, soft tissue, muscle\nand digestive tract.\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis. Some occur with other diseases and improve\nwith treatment. Other types may lead to life-threatening organ failure.\nTreatments may include chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer. Other medicines can\nreduce amyloid production and manage symptoms. Some people may benefit from organ or\nblood stem cell transplants.\nSymptoms\nYou may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease.\nSymptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.\nCommon symptoms of amyloidosis may include:\nSerious fatigue and weakness.\nShortness of breath.\nNumbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet.\nSwelling of the ankles and legs.\nAdditional symptoms may include:\nDizziness.\nLow blood pressure.\nDiarrhea, possibly with blood.\nConstipation.\nNausea and loss of appetite.\nWeight loss.\nAn enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge.\nk\nc\nSkin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and dark or purple patches around the b a\nd\ne\neyes. F e\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you regularly experience any of the symptoms associated\nwith amyloidosis.\nCauses\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused\nby outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect\nmultiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body.\nTypes of amyloidosis include:\nAL amyloidosis, also called immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. This is one of the\nmost common types of amyloidosis in developed countries. AL amyloidosis used to be called\nprimary amyloidosis. It often affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves. It can be associated\nwith multiple myeloma or other blood conditions.\nWild-type ATTR amyloidosis, also called transthyretin amyloidosis. This type also has\nbeen called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when the transthyretin protein, also called\nTTR, made by the liver produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis\ntends to affect men over age 60 and often targets the heart. It also can cause carpal tunnel\nsyndrome.\nHereditary ATTR amyloidosis, also called familial transthyretin amyloidosis. This\ninherited condition often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens\nwith changes to the TTR protein made by your liver. This altered protein is passed down\nthrough families.\nOther hereditary forms of amyloidosis. There are other hereditary forms of amyloidosis.\nThese are more rare. They can affect different organs, depending on the type and how\nproteins are affected. Examples include apolipoprotein A-1 amyloidosis, gelsolin amyloidosis\nand fibrinogen amyloidosis.\nAA amyloidosis. This is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's often triggered by a\nchronic inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the\nkidneys, liver and spleen.\nLocalized amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis has a better prognosis than varieties that\naffect multiple organ systems. It is, however, not common. Typical sites for localized\namyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so\ntreatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.\nRisk factors\nFactors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include:\nAge. Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are over the age of 50.\nSex assigned at birth. Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.\nOther diseases. Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of\nk\nAA amyloidosis. c\na\nb\nd\ne\nFamily history. Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary. e\nF\n\nDialysis. Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis,\ncertain proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This\ncondition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.\nRace. People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a version of the TTR\nprotein that is associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.\nComplications\nAmyloidosis can seriously damage the:\nHeart. Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is\npumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the\nheart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart\nproblems can become life-threatening.\nKidneys. Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove\nwaste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.\nNervous system. Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and\nfeet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of\nalternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can\nmake people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.
