| **Task title** | Synthroid |
| **Task topic** | How to take Synthroid medication correctly |
| **Task description** | Synthroid (levothyroxine) is a prescription thyroid hormone replacement medication used to treat hypothyroidism. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Synthroid, including how to take it correctly, foods and supplements that affect absorption, and important safety considerations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Synthroid to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of timing requirements for taking the medication, foods and supplements that interfere with absorption, and safety warnings, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Synthroid, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to schedule Synthroid with other supplements like calcium or iron. 2. How to interpret common side effects and know when they are expected versus concerning. 3. How to prepare for blood tests that measure thyroid function. |
