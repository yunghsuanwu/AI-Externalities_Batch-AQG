| **Task title** | Amyloidosis |
| **Task topic** | Understanding amyloidosis symptoms and complications |
| **Task description** | Amyloidosis is a rare disease that occurs when abnormal proteins called amyloid build up in organs and tissues, potentially affecting the heart, kidneys, liver, and nervous system. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about amyloidosis, including its symptoms, how it affects different organs, and the types of complications it can cause. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about amyloidosis to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the symptoms of amyloidosis in different body systems, the organs most commonly affected by amyloid deposits, and the serious complications that can arise from the disease, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about amyloidosis, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Recognizing which symptoms suggest amyloidosis is affecting specific organs like the heart, kidneys, or nervous system. 2. Distinguishing between different symptom patterns and determining which organ systems are most likely involved. 3. Understanding when symptoms become serious enough to indicate potentially life-threatening complications. |
