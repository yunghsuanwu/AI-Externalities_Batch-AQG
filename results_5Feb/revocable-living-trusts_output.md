## Stage 3: Curriculum Designer

Now I'll derive learning objectives and familiarity quiz from the finalized comprehension questions.

### Learning Objectives (Derived from CQ1-CQ9)

**LO1 (from CQ1-CQ3):** Identify the key components and roles in a revocable living trust, including which assets require special handling and what happens to unfunded assets.
- Maps to: CQ1 (beneficiary designations), CQ2 (unfunded assets), CQ3 (settlor as trustee)

**LO2 (from CQ4-CQ6):** Explain the relationship between revocable living trusts and creditor protection, estate taxes, and asset funding requirements.
- Maps to: CQ4 (why no creditor protection), CQ5 (funding process), CQ6 (estate tax relationship)

**LO3 (from CQ7-CQ9):** Apply trust planning principles to evaluate real-world scenarios involving incapacity planning, asset transfer timing, and proper trust funding.
- Maps to: CQ7 (incapacity advantage), CQ8 (retirement account scenario), CQ9 (unfunded property)

### Familiarity Quiz Design

**Analyzing CQ themes:**
- Domain terms: trusts, estates, probate, beneficiaries, creditors
- Domain concepts: estate planning, asset protection, legal documents
- Task terms: revocable living trust, settlor, trustee, funding, pour-over will
- Task concepts: trust mechanics, probate avoidance, incapacity planning

**FQ1 (Domain, Remembering):**
"How familiar are you with basic estate planning terms such as wills, probate, and beneficiaries?"

**FQ2 (Domain, Understanding):**
"How well do you understand how estate planning tools like wills and trusts are used to transfer property after death?"

**FQ3 (Task, Remembering):**
"How familiar are you with revocable living trust terminology such as settlor, trustee, and trust funding?"

**FQ4 (Task, Understanding):**
"How well do you understand how revocable living trusts work, including how assets are transferred into them and what happens when the trust creator dies or becomes incapacitated?"

### Task Instructions

**Task Description:**
A revocable living trust is an estate planning tool that allows property to pass outside of probate while maintaining the creator's control during their lifetime. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about revocable living trusts, including how they differ from wills, how assets are transferred into trusts, and the advantages and limitations of using trusts.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about revocable living trusts to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how trust funding works, what happens to assets not transferred into the trust, and the differences between probate and trust administration, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about revocable living trusts, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific assets (like retirement accounts vs. real estate) should be transferred into a trust or handled differently. 2. Understanding what happens when someone creates a trust but fails to transfer all their assets before death or incapacity. 3. Evaluating whether a revocable living trust is appropriate for different situations based on factors like estate size, age, privacy needs, and creditor protection goals.
