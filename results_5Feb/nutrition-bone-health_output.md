| **Task title** | Nutrition and bone health |
| **Task topic** | Dietary strategies for bone strength |
| **Task description** | Bones are living tissue that require proper nutrition throughout life to maintain strength and prevent conditions like osteoporosis. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about nutrition and bone health, including key nutrients for bone strength, calcium and vitamin D requirements, and dietary strategies to support skeletal health. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about nutrition and bone health to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of calcium requirements for different age groups, vitamin D sources and recommended intake, and how specific nutrients like protein and magnesium support bone health, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about nutrition and bone health, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining appropriate calcium intake for individuals at different life stages and evaluating whether specific food choices meet daily requirements. 2. Identifying reliable vitamin D sources and understanding absorption factors that affect bone health in real-world scenarios. 3. Making dietary decisions that balance multiple bone-supporting nutrients when planning meals for people with specific health considerations. |

| **Question** | Participants | Susan, a 58-year-old lactose-intolerant woman, wants to meet her 1,200 mg daily calcium requirement without dairy. She plans to eat 1 cup of fortified orange juice (300 mg calcium), 3 ounces of canned salmon with bones (180 mg), and 1 cup of cooked collard greens (230 mg). What should she do to meet her calcium goal while supporting overall bone health? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. This combination provides adequate calcium; no changes needed", "B. Add one more cup of orange juice to reach exactly 1,200 mg", "C. Add another calcium source to reach 1,200 mg and ensure adequate protein and vitamin D intake", "D. Replace the salmon with tofu to avoid excess protein that damages bones", "E. Take a 1,200 mg calcium supplement since non-dairy sources are poorly absorbed"] |
