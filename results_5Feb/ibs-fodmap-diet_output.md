## Reference Material Analysis

**Source:** Monash University FODMAP Diet Guide
**Scope:** 3-step FODMAP diet process for IBS management

**Key Testable Content:**
1. **Step 1 - Low FODMAP (Elimination):**
   - Duration: 2-6 weeks
   - Purpose: Symptom reduction
   - All high FODMAP foods avoided
   - Dietitian guidance recommended

2. **Step 2 - Reintroduction (Challenge):**
   - Duration: 8-12 weeks
   - Systematic testing of FODMAP groups
   - One food per test, 3 days
   - Continue low FODMAP base diet

3. **Step 3 - Personalization (Modified FODMAP):**
   - Long-term sustainable diet
   - Based on individual tolerances
   - Includes tolerated FODMAPs
   - Liberalized where possible

4. **FODMAP Categories:**
   - Oligosaccharides (fructans, GOS)
   - Disaccharides (lactose)
   - Monosaccharides (fructose)
   - Polyols (sorbitol, mannitol)

5. **Important Principles:**
   - Not a lifelong elimination diet
   - Requires professional guidance
   - Individual tolerance varies
   - Goal: maximize variety while minimizing symptoms

## Familiarity Quiz Generation

**FQ1 (Domain - Remembering):**
How familiar are you with common health and nutrition terms such as carbohydrates, digestive system, and dietary fiber?

**FQ2 (Domain - Understanding):**
How well do you understand how different types of nutrients are digested and absorbed in the body, and how diet affects digestive health?

**FQ3 (Task - Remembering):**
How familiar are you with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and FODMAP diet terms such as elimination diet, food reintroduction, and dietary triggers?

**FQ4 (Task - Understanding):**
How well do you understand how systematic dietary elimination and reintroduction can help identify food intolerances and manage digestive symptoms?

## Task Instructions

**Task Description (General):**
The FODMAP diet is a 3-step dietary approach used to manage Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) by identifying individual food triggers. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the FODMAP diet, including the purpose and duration of each step, how to conduct food reintroduction tests, and how to create a personalized long-term diet.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the FODMAP diet to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the timeframes for each diet step, the proper procedure for testing FODMAP foods, and the principles of personalizing the diet long-term, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about the FODMAP diet, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Deciding when to move between the three steps of the FODMAP diet and avoiding staying in the elimination phase too long. 2. Properly conducting food reintroduction tests while maintaining a low FODMAP base diet to identify specific triggers. 3. Creating a personalized long-term diet that includes tolerated FODMAP foods while avoiding those that cause symptoms.
