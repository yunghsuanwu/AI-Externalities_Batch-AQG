- B: Related to accommodations but not lactation-specific
- D: Related to employment discrimination but different focus
- E: General civil rights but not lactation-specific

---

### UNDERSTANDING LEVEL CANDIDATES (CQ4-CQ6)

**Candidate U1:**
**Question:** Why does the EEOC consider pregnancy discrimination to be a form of sex discrimination under Title VII?
- A. Because only women can become pregnant, treating them differently based on pregnancy is sex-based discrimination ✓
- B. Because pregnancy affects women's ability to work in all cases
- C. Because pregnant women are considered a protected disability class
- D. Because pregnancy is a temporary condition affecting job performance
- E. Because federal law specifically lists pregnancy as a separate protected class

**Source Evidence:** Document explains PDA amended Title VII to clarify pregnancy discrimination is sex discrimination.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- B: Incorrect assumption about work ability
- C: Confuses PDA with ADA protections
- D: Focuses on wrong aspect (temporariness)

**Source Evidence:** Document explains harassment must be "severe or pervasive" to create hostile work environment.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Too broad/incorrect standard
- B: Too narrow (excludes verbal harassment)
- D: Incorrect limitation on who can harass
- E: Arbitrary numerical threshold

---

**Candidate U3:**
**Question:** How does the interaction between the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) benefit pregnant workers?

- B. Pregnancy complications that substantially limit major life activities may qualify for ADA protections in addition to PDA protections ✓
- C. Workers must choose between filing under PDA or ADA, but not both
- D. The ADA only applies after childbirth, not during pregnancy
- E. The PDA requires a disability diagnosis while the ADA does not

**Source Evidence:** Document explains pregnancy-related impairments may qualify under ADA if they substantially limit major life activities.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Incorrect replacement relationship
- C: False either/or choice
- D: Incorrect temporal limitation
- E: Reverses the requirements

---

**Candidate U4:**
**Question:** Why must employers who provide light duty or modified work for injured employees also provide such accommodations to pregnant employees with similar work restrictions?
- A. Pregnancy is legally classified as an injury
- B. Federal law requires identical policies for all medical conditions
- C. Employers must treat pregnant employees the same as other employees similar in their ability or inability to work ✓
- D. Light duty is only required for workplace injuries, not pregnancy
- E. Pregnant employees are automatically entitled to more benefits than other workers

**Source Evidence:** Document states employers must treat pregnant workers "the same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work."

- E: Suggests preferential treatment rather than equal treatment

---

### APPLYING LEVEL CANDIDATES (CQ7-CQ9)

**Candidate A1:**
**Question:** Maria works as a warehouse associate for a company with 200 employees. She is 5 months pregnant and asks for a temporary reassignment to avoid heavy lifting, which her doctor has restricted. The company has a policy of providing light duty to workers injured on the job. What should the employer do?
- A. Deny the request because pregnancy is not a workplace injury
- B. Require Maria to take unpaid leave until after childbirth
- C. Provide the light duty accommodation since they provide it to other employees with lifting restrictions ✓
- D. Offer light duty only if Maria files an ADA disability claim
- E. Grant the accommodation but reduce her pay to reflect easier work

**Source Evidence:** Document requires employers to treat pregnant workers same as others similar in ability to work, including light duty policies.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Incorrect interpretation of equal treatment requirement
- B: Discriminatory response
- D: Adds unnecessary procedural barrier
- E: Discriminatory pay reduction

---

**Candidate A2:**
**Question:** Jennifer's supervisor frequently makes jokes about her pregnancy, asking if she's "ready to stay home where she belongs" and commenting that pregnant women "can't handle real work." Other coworkers laugh but Jennifer feels uncomfortable and less respected. Under EEOC guidance, is this unlawful harassment?
- A. No, because the comments are meant as jokes, not serious discrimination
- B. No, because coworkers laughing shows the environment is friendly
- C. Yes, if the comments are frequent enough to create a hostile work environment based on pregnancy ✓
- D. Yes, but only if Jennifer's job performance has been affected
- E. No, because no employment action (like termination) has occurred

**Source Evidence:** Document explains harassment includes "offensive comments" that are "severe or pervasive" enough to create hostile environment.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Intent doesn't negate harassment
- B: Misunderstands hostile environment standard
- D: Job performance impact not required
- E: Hostile environment doesn't require adverse employment action

---

**Candidate A3:**
**Question:** Lisa works for a 12-person marketing firm and requests a flexible schedule to attend prenatal appointments. Her employer denies the request, stating they're too small to be covered by pregnancy discrimination laws. Is the employer's position legally correct?
- A. Yes, companies with fewer than 15 employees are exempt from the PDA ✓
- B. No, all employers must accommodate pregnancy regardless of size
- C. Yes, but only if the state has no pregnancy discrimination laws
- D. No, prenatal appointments are specifically protected under federal law for all employers
- E. Yes, but the employer must still provide unpaid leave under FMLA

**Source Evidence:** Document states PDA applies to employers with "15 or more employees."

**Distractor Rationale:**
- B: Incorrect - federal PDA has size threshold
- C: True they may not be covered federally, but state laws vary
- D: Overstates federal protections
- E: FMLA also has 50-employee threshold

---

**Candidate A4:**
**Question:** Sarah recently returned from maternity leave and requests a private space and break time to pump breast milk. Her manager says she can use the restroom and take unpaid breaks. The company has 45 employees. What is the employer legally required to provide under the PUMP Act?
- A. The restroom accommodation is sufficient as long as breaks are provided
- B. A private space (not a bathroom) and reasonable break time, which may be unpaid for non-exempt employees ✓
- C. A private space but no requirement to provide any break time
- D. Paid breaks and a private space only for exempt employees

**Source Evidence:** Document explains PUMP Act requires private space (not bathroom) and reasonable break time for lactation.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Bathroom not acceptable under PUMP Act
- C: Incomplete - breaks also required
- D: Reverses exemption rules
- E: Misunderstands the legal requirement

---

**Candidate A5:**
**Question:** Angela is 7 months pregnant and works as a retail sales associate. She tells her manager about complications requiring her to sit periodically throughout her shift. Her manager responds, "We've never allowed sitting on the sales floor. If you can't do the job, maybe you should resign." Angela is later terminated for "inability to meet job requirements." What legal issue exists?
- A. No issue because standing is a legitimate job requirement for retail
- B. Potential pregnancy discrimination and failure to engage in the accommodation process ✓
- C. No issue because the manager didn't mention her pregnancy in the termination
- D. Only an ADA violation if Angela has a documented disability
- E. No issue if the company has a consistent no-sitting policy

**Source Evidence:** Document requires employers to consider reasonable accommodations and prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy.

**Distractor Rationale:**
- A: Ignores accommodation obligation

## Step 4: Curriculum Design

### Task Instructions Generation

**Task Description (General):**
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) protects pregnant workers from discrimination and requires reasonable workplace accommodations. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about pregnancy discrimination protections, including employer obligations, accommodation requirements, harassment standards, and the interaction between different federal laws.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about pregnancy discrimination protections to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which employers are covered, what types of accommodations are required, and how harassment is defined under the law, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about pregnancy discrimination protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether an employer is required to provide accommodations in specific workplace scenarios, considering factors like company size and existing policies. 2. How to identify when pregnancy-related comments or behaviors cross the line into unlawful harassment. 3. How different federal laws (PDA, ADA, PUMP Act) interact to protect pregnant and postpartum workers in various situations.

### Familiarity Quiz Generation (FQ1-FQ4)

**FQ1 (Domain, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with common legal terms related to employment law, such as Title VII, protected classes, and discrimination?

**FQ2 (Domain, Understanding):**
How well do you understand how federal employment laws establish protections for different groups of workers and what obligations they place on employers?

**FQ3 (Task, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with pregnancy discrimination terms and protections, such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, reasonable accommodation, and hostile work environment?

**FQ4 (Task, Understanding):**
How well do you understand the mechanisms by which pregnancy discrimination laws protect workers, such as equal treatment standards and accommodation requirements?
