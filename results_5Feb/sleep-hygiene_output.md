I'll process the attached PDF and generate a quiz on sleep hygiene. Let me read the reference material first.

The reference material is a comprehensive NHS guide on sleep hygiene that covers sleep requirements, factors affecting sleep, and practical strategies for improving sleep quality. This provides excellent specific, testable content for challenging questions.

I'll now proceed through the workflow to generate 9 comprehension questions (CQ1-CQ9) across Bloom's taxonomy levels, along with familiarity questions (FQ1-FQ4).

| **Task title** | Sleep hygiene |
| **Task topic** | Sleep hygiene practices |
| **Task description** | Sleep hygiene refers to habits and practices that promote good quality sleep and full daytime alertness. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about sleep hygiene, including the factors that affect sleep quality, recommended sleep durations for different age groups, and specific behavioral strategies that can improve or hinder sleep. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about sleep hygiene to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of recommended sleep durations by age, environmental factors affecting sleep quality, and timing of activities like exercise and caffeine consumption, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about sleep hygiene, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to adjust bedroom environment and pre-sleep routines when experiencing difficulty falling asleep. 2. How to handle situations involving evening exercise, late-night caffeine intake, or screen time before bed. 3. How to apply sleep hygiene principles when dealing with shift work, jet lag, or irregular sleep schedules. |

| **Question** | Participants | Emma typically sleeps from 11 PM to 7 AM on weekdays but struggles with insomnia. On weekends, she sleeps in until 10 AM to "catch up" on sleep and often takes a 90-minute nap on Sunday afternoon. She wonders why she has trouble falling asleep Sunday night.
