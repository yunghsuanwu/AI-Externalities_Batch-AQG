A. Every 2 years
B. Every 5 years ✓
C. Every 7 years
D. Every 10 years

A. Literacy rate below 50%
B. Literacy rate below 75%
C. Literacy rate below the state average
D. Literacy rate below the national average ✓
E. Literacy rate below 90%

**Source evidence:** Document states "literacy rate in English less than the national average"
**Distractor rationale:**

- C: State vs national comparison confusion

### Candidate Questions - Understanding Level (5 candidates)

**U1:**
Why does Section 203 require BOTH a numerical threshold (10,000) AND a percentage threshold (5%) for coverage determination?

A. To ensure only the largest language groups receive protection
B. To allow coverage in both large and small jurisdictions where language minorities face barriers ✓
C. To prevent too many jurisdictions from being covered
D. To simplify the Census Bureau's calculation process
E. To prioritize urban areas over rural areas

**Source evidence:** The dual threshold ensures coverage in large cities (10,000) and smaller communities where minorities are significant percentage (5%)
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Misunderstands purpose - coverage is about access, not size
- C: Opposite of intent
- D: Administrative ease isn't the goal
- E: No geographic preference in law

**U2:**
How does the "limited-English proficient" (LEP) criterion in Section 203 differ from simply not speaking English at all?

A. LEP only counts citizens who speak no English
B. LEP includes citizens who speak some English but not well enough to participate effectively in elections ✓
C. LEP is determined by educational attainment rather than language ability
D. LEP only applies to first-generation immigrants
E. LEP is the same as illiteracy in all languages

**Source evidence:** Document explains LEP as inability to speak or understand English adequately to participate
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Too restrictive interpretation
- C: Confuses literacy with language proficiency
- D: Adds immigration status requirement not in statute
- E: Conflates language and literacy

A. Coverage only applies to federal elections
B. Coverage only applies to state and local elections
C. Coverage applies to all elections conducted in the covered jurisdiction ✓

**Source evidence:** Document indicates comprehensive coverage of all elections in covered jurisdictions
**Distractor rationale:**
- A, B: Partial coverage misconceptions
- D: Misunderstands trigger (voter access, not candidate presence)
- E: Suggests flexibility not in statute

**U4:**
Why does Section 203 require oral assistance even when written translations are provided?

A. Because written translations alone may not help voters who are not literate in their native language ✓
B. Because oral assistance is cheaper than written materials
C. Because election officials prefer oral communication
D. Because written translations are often inaccurate
E. Because federal law prohibits relying solely on written materials

**Source evidence:** Document mentions both written and oral assistance requirements; addresses literacy barriers
**Distractor rationale:**
- B: Cost isn't the reason for dual requirements
- C: Preference isn't the legal basis
- D: Impugns translation quality without basis
- E: Overstates legal requirement

**U5:**
How does Section 203 distinguish between "coverage" and "compliance"?

A. Coverage is automatic based on census data; compliance requires jurisdictions to actively provide language assistance ✓
B. Coverage and compliance are the same thing

**Source evidence:** Census Bureau determines coverage; jurisdictions must then comply with requirements
**Distractor rationale:**
- B: Conflates determination with implementation
- C: Both are mandatory once triggered
- D: Geographic distinction not in statute
- E: Misidentifies responsible agencies

### Candidate Questions - Applying Level (5 candidates)

**A1:**
A county has 8,500 Spanish-heritage citizens who are limited-English proficient, representing 4.8% of the citizen voting age population, with an English literacy rate of 82% (national average: 85%). Should this county be covered under Section 203?

A. Yes, because the literacy rate is below the national average
B. No, because it fails both the 10,000 and 5% thresholds ✓
C. Yes, because it meets the literacy requirement and the percentage is close to 5%
D. No, because only the literacy rate matters for coverage
E. Yes, because Spanish-heritage citizens are a protected group

**Source evidence:** Must meet numerical threshold (10,000 OR 5%) AND literacy threshold
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Meets literacy but not population threshold
- C: "Close to 5%" isn't sufficient
- D: Misunderstands multi-factor test
- E: Being protected group alone isn't sufficient

**A2:**
A jurisdiction covered under Section 203 for Spanish-language assistance receives a complaint that Vietnamese-speaking voters also need assistance, though the Vietnamese-speaking population is only 2,000 citizens (1% of voting age population). What is the jurisdiction's legal obligation?

A. Must immediately provide Vietnamese assistance because all language minorities deserve equal treatment
B. Must provide Vietnamese assistance only if DOJ orders it
C. Has no legal obligation under Section 203 to provide Vietnamese assistance based on current coverage determination ✓
D. Must provide Vietnamese assistance for federal but not state elections
E. Must conduct its own survey to determine if Vietnamese assistance is needed

**Source evidence:** Coverage is based on Census Bureau determination of specific language groups meeting thresholds
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Confuses equity principle with statutory trigger
- B: Suggests enforcement action required
- D: Adds federal/state distinction not present
- E: Jurisdictions don't make their own determinations

**A3:**
An election official in a Section 203-covered jurisdiction wants to save money by providing only written translations of ballots, arguing that oral assistance is redundant. The official notes that literacy rates in the covered language minority group are high. What is the most likely legal outcome if this practice is challenged?

A. The practice is acceptable if literacy rates in the minority language are high
B. The practice is acceptable if voters don't specifically request oral assistance
C. The practice violates Section 203 because both written and oral assistance are required ✓
D. The practice is acceptable for local elections but not federal elections
E. The practice is acceptable if translations are reviewed for accuracy

**Source evidence:** Document indicates comprehensive assistance requirements; oral assistance is mandatory
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Makes logical argument but statute doesn't allow this exemption
- B: Assistance required proactively, not on request
- D: No federal/local distinction in requirements
- E: Accuracy doesn't substitute for oral component

**A4:**
A jurisdiction becomes covered under Section 203 based on the 2020 Census. In 2023, local officials argue that many language minority citizens have learned English well and the jurisdiction should be removed from coverage. Can the jurisdiction be removed from Section 203 coverage before the next Census?

A. Yes, if the jurisdiction can prove English proficiency has improved
B. Yes, if voter turnout among language minorities increases
C. No, coverage determinations are made by the Census Bureau based on census data and updated after subsequent determinations ✓
D. Yes, if DOJ agrees that assistance is no longer needed
E. No, coverage is permanent once triggered

**Source evidence:** Census Bureau makes determinations based on census data at regular intervals
**Distractor rationale:**
- A, B: Suggests interim removal based on local data
- D: Gives DOJ discretion it doesn't have
- E: Overstates permanence - can be removed at next determination

**A5:**
A city of 500,000 has three language minority groups: 12,000 Spanish-heritage LEP citizens (3%), 8,000 Vietnamese LEP citizens (1.6%), and 15,000 Chinese LEP citizens (3.5%). All three groups have literacy rates below the national average. For which language groups must the city provide Section 203 assistance?

A. All three groups because they all have below-average literacy rates
B. Only Spanish-heritage citizens because they are specifically named in the statute
C. Only Chinese-heritage citizens because they exceed 10,000 ✓
D. Spanish and Chinese groups because together they exceed 10,000
E. None, because no single group exceeds 5%

**Source evidence:** Must meet 10,000 OR 5% for EACH language group separately; Asian American includes Chinese
**Distractor rationale:**
- A: Literacy alone insufficient; must meet population threshold
- B: All four groups are named in statute
- D: Can't combine groups to meet threshold
- E: Chinese group exceeds 10,000 threshold

| **Task description** | Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act requires certain jurisdictions to provide election materials and assistance in languages other than English for specific minority groups. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Section 203 language minority protections, including coverage thresholds, covered language groups, required forms of assistance, and how jurisdictions determine compliance obligations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Section 203 language minority voting protections to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of coverage thresholds and criteria, types of language assistance required, and how coverage determinations are made, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Section 203 language minority voting protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a specific jurisdiction meets the criteria for Section 203 coverage based on population data and literacy rates. 2. Identifying what types of language assistance a covered jurisdiction must provide and which language groups are entitled to protection. 3. Evaluating whether a jurisdiction's proposed changes to its language assistance program would comply with Section 203 requirements. |
