| **Task topic** | Understanding mutual fund investments |
| **Task description** | Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about mutual funds, including how they operate, their fee structures, and the different types available to investors. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about mutual funds to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how mutual funds are priced and traded, the different types of mutual fund share classes and their fee structures, and the various categories of mutual funds based on their investment objectives, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about mutual funds, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate the true cost of investing in a mutual fund by understanding the relationship between share classes, sales loads, and ongoing expenses. 2. How to determine which type of mutual fund aligns with specific investment goals and risk tolerance levels. 3. How to assess whether a mutual fund's pricing and redemption features match an investor's liquidity needs and investment timeline. |

| **Question** | Participants | Sarah has $10,000 to invest in a mutual fund and plans to hold the investment for at least 10 years. She is comparing two share classes of the same fund: Class A with a 5% front-end load and 0.5% annual expenses, versus Class C with no front-end load but 1.5% annual expenses and a 1% redemption fee if sold within one year. Which option results in lower total costs over her 10-year holding period? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Class A shares because the one-time front-end load is less expensive than the higher ongoing annual expenses of Class C", "B. Class C shares because avoiding the front-end load saves more money than the difference in annual expenses", "C. Both options cost exactly the same over a 10-year period", "D. Class C shares because the redemption fee only applies if she sells within one year", "E. Class A shares but only if she invests more than $25,000 to qualify for breakpoint discounts"] |
