I'll generate a quiz about Qigong using the automatic question generation workflow. Let me process this step by step.

## Workflow Analysis

**Input Detection:**
- Reference material provided: `/Users/WuYung-Hsuan/Desktop/coding-stuff/AI-Externalities_Batch-AQG/reference_materials/qigong.pdf`
- No sample questions provided
- **Path: B (Source Materials Provided)** - Skip Source Discovery and Domain Expert, start with Question Writer

Let me proceed through the workflow:

## STEP 1: Reference Material Analysis

I need to access the PDF file to analyze its content. However, I notice the file path is a local path on your machine. Let me check if I can access this file or if you can provide the content.

**CRITICAL: Human Clarification Required**

I see you've indicated reference materials should be provided (qigong.pdf), but I need to verify I can access this file. Could you please:

1. **Confirm the PDF is attached to this conversation**, OR
2. **Provide the URL to the Cleveland Clinic article** (https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-qigong), OR
3. **Share the PDF content directly** so I can proceed with question generation?

Once I have access to the reference material, I'll continue with:
- Question Writer → Generate 12-15 candidate questions
- Psychometric Reviewer → Select best 9 questions (3 Remembering, 3 Understanding, 3 Applying)
- Curriculum Designer → Derive learning objectives and familiarity quiz
- Consistency Agent → Format to Empirica template

Please provide the reference material so I can proceed with generating your Qigong quiz.
