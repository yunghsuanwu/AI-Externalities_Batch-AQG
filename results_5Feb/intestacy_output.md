| **Task title** | Intestacy |
| **Task topic** | Intestacy in New York State |
| **Task description** | Intestacy occurs when someone dies without a valid will, and New York law determines how their property is distributed among surviving relatives. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about intestacy in New York State, including who inherits property, the order of priority among relatives, and the administration process for intestate estates. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about intestacy in New York State to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how property is distributed when someone dies without a will, which relatives have priority in inheriting, and what happens when certain family members are alive or deceased, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about intestacy in New York State, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining who inherits and in what shares when a person dies without a will in various family situations (with spouse, children, parents, or siblings). 2. Understanding how the presence or absence of specific relatives affects the distribution of an intestate estate. 3. Identifying the priority order among family members and what happens when higher-priority relatives are not alive. |
