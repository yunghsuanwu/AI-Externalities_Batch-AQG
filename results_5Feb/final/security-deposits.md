| **Task title** | Security deposits |
| **Task topic** | California security deposit laws |
| **Task description** | Security deposits are one of the most common sources of disputes between California landlords and tenants. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about California security deposit laws, including maximum deposit amounts, lawful deductions, timeline requirements, and tenant remedies when violations occur. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about California security deposit laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of maximum deposit limits for different property types, the 21-day return deadline and what happens when it's missed, and what distinguishes normal wear and tear from tenant-caused damage, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about California security deposit laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether a security deposit amount or deduction violates California's legal limits. 2. How to evaluate whether specific types of wear or damage can lawfully be deducted from a deposit. 3. What remedies are available to tenants when landlords fail to meet their legal obligations regarding deposit returns. |
