| **Task ID** | section-203-language-minority |
| **Task title** | Section 203 protection for language minorities |
| **Task topic** | Voting Rights Act language assistance requirements |
| **Task description** | Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act requires certain jurisdictions to provide election materials and assistance in languages other than English for specific minority groups. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Section 203 language minority protections, including coverage thresholds, covered language groups, required forms of assistance, and how jurisdictions determine compliance obligations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Section 203 language minority voting protections to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of coverage thresholds and criteria, types of language assistance required, and how coverage determinations are made, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Section 203 language minority voting protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a specific jurisdiction meets the criteria for Section 203 coverage based on population data and literacy rates. 2. Identifying what types of language assistance a covered jurisdiction must provide and which language groups are entitled to protection. 3. Evaluating whether a jurisdiction's proposed changes to its language assistance program would comply with Section 203 requirements. |

All three groups have literacy rates below the national average. For which language groups must the city provide Section 203 assistance? |

| **Question** | Participants | An election official in a Section 203-covered jurisdiction wants to save money by providing only written translations of ballots, arguing that oral assistance is redundant.

| **Options** | Participants | ["A. The practice is acceptable if literacy rates in the minority language are high", "B. The practice is acceptable if voters don't specifically request oral assistance", "C. The practice violates Section 203 because both written and oral assistance are required", "D. The practice is acceptable for local elections but not federal elections", "E. The practice is acceptable if translations are reviewed for accuracy"] |
