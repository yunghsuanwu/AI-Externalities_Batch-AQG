| **Task title** | Unemployment insurance |
| **Task topic** | Understanding unemployment insurance benefits |
| **Task description** | Unemployment insurance provides temporary financial assistance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about unemployment insurance, including eligibility requirements, benefit calculations, and the claims process. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about unemployment insurance to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of eligibility requirements for receiving benefits, how benefit amounts are calculated, and the responsibilities of unemployed workers receiving benefits, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about unemployment insurance, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific situations qualify someone for unemployment benefits based on the reason for job separation. 2. Understanding how different factors like work history and state variations affect benefit amounts and duration. 3. Evaluating what actions unemployed workers must take to maintain eligibility while receiving benefits. |
