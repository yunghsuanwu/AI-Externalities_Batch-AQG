| **Task title** | Voter protection |
| **Task topic** | Federal voter protection laws and regulations |
| **Task description** | Federal law provides strong protections for voters against intimidation and interference at polling places. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about voter protection laws, including what constitutes illegal voter intimidation, who enforces these protections, and the specific rights voters have at polling locations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about voter protection laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what behaviors constitute illegal voter intimidation, which federal agencies enforce voting rights laws, and what legal protections exist for voters at polling places, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about voter protection laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific behaviors at polling places violate federal voter intimidation laws based on factors like intent, location, and type of conduct. 2. Identifying which federal laws and agencies apply to different types of voter interference scenarios. 3. Understanding what actions voters can take and which authorities to contact when they experience or witness potential voter intimidation. |

| **Question** | Participants | A group plans to monitor a polling place in a neighborhood with many immigrant voters. They intend to: (1) stand 150 feet from the entrance, (2) hold signs asking "Are you a citizen?", (3) photograph people entering, and (4) tell anyone who approaches them that they are "preventing voter fraud." They will not block access or speak to voters unless approached. Which aspect of this plan is MOST likely to violate federal voter intimidation law? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Standing 150 feet away, because federal law requires monitors to stay at least 200 feet from polling places", "B. Holding signs with political messages, because all electioneering is prohibited near polling places", "C. The combination of photographing voters and questioning citizenship, which could reasonably intimidate eligible voters from casting ballots", "D. Speaking only when approached, because federal law prohibits any verbal interaction with voters near polling places", "E. Their stated purpose of preventing fraud, because only designated election officials can challenge voter eligibility"] |
