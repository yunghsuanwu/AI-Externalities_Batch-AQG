| **Task topic** | Voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions |
| **Task description** | Understanding voting eligibility after a criminal conviction is crucial for exercising democratic rights. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions in Pennsylvania, including when voting rights are lost, how they can be restored, and the specific rules for different types of convictions and incarceration statuses. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of when convicted individuals lose and regain voting rights, the differences between felony and misdemeanor convictions, and the voter registration process after conviction, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining voting eligibility for individuals in different incarceration situations (county jail, state prison, probation, parole). 2. Understanding the specific conditions under which someone convicted of a felony can register to vote. 3. Navigating the voter registration process for individuals with past convictions who have completed their sentences. |
