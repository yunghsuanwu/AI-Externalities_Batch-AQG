| **Task topic** | Voting rights and federal election protections |
| **Task description** | The right to vote is fundamental to American democracy, yet many citizens are unaware of the specific legal protections that safeguard this right. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about voting rights, including federal laws that protect voters from discrimination, requirements for voting accessibility, and the distinctions between different types of elections. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about voting rights and federal election protections to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the Voting Rights Act and its protections against discrimination, federal requirements for accessible voting for people with disabilities, and the differences between federal and state election regulations, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about voting rights and federal election protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which federal laws apply when voters face discrimination or accessibility barriers at polling places. 2. Understanding what accommodations polling places must provide under federal law and when violations can be reported. 3. Distinguishing between voting rights protections that apply to all elections versus those specific to federal elections only. |
