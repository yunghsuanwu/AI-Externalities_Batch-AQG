| **Task ID** | relaxation-techniques |
| **Task title** | Relaxation techniques |
| **Task topic** | Evidence-based relaxation techniques for stress management |
| **Task description** | Relaxation techniques are practices that can help reduce stress and promote physical and mental wellbeing. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about relaxation techniques, including the different types of techniques available, how they work, safety considerations, and how to use them effectively as part of a comprehensive approach to health. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about relaxation techniques to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the different types of relaxation techniques and how they work, safety considerations for people with existing health conditions, and how to use these techniques effectively alongside conventional medical care, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about relaxation techniques, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. When and how to consult healthcare providers before beginning relaxation practices, especially with existing health conditions. 2. How to respond appropriately when experiencing unexpected reactions during relaxation practice. 3. How to choose and persist with relaxation techniques that work best for individual needs while using them as complementary approaches to conventional care. |
