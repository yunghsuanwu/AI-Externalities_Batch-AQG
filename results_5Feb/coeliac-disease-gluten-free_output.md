# Analyzing Reference Material and Generating Quiz

I'll process the reference material about coeliac disease and gluten-free diet to generate a comprehensive quiz following the Automatic Question Generation workflow.

## Step 4: Curriculum Design

### Deriving Learning Objectives from Final Questions:

**LO1 (Remembering):** Identify which grains naturally contain gluten (wheat, barley, rye) and which grains and foods are naturally gluten-free and safe for people with coeliac disease.

**LO2 (Remembering):** Recall the UK regulatory threshold for gluten-free food labeling (20 parts per million) and recognize safe oat products.

**LO3 (Understanding):** Explain why cross-contamination poses risks in food preparation and identify high-risk scenarios for gluten exposure.

**LO4 (Understanding):** Explain the nutritional considerations in a gluten-free diet, including why fiber supplementation may be needed and why naturally gluten-free whole foods offer advantages over processed substitutes.

**LO5 (Applying):** Apply cross-contamination prevention strategies in real-world food preparation and dining situations.

**LO6 (Applying):** Evaluate food labels and meal plans to make safe gluten-free choices that meet nutritional needs.

### Familiarity Quiz Generation:

**FQ1:** How familiar are you with common dietary and nutrition terms such as gluten, allergens, and food labeling?

**FQ2:** How well do you understand basic concepts of nutrition and digestion, such as how nutrients are absorbed and what causes food intolerances?

**FQ3:** How familiar are you with coeliac disease-related terms such as cross-contamination, gluten-free labeling standards, and safe grain alternatives?

**FQ4:** How well do you understand the mechanisms behind coeliac disease, such as how gluten damages the small intestine and why strict dietary adherence is necessary?

## Step 5: Consistency Check & Final Formatting

| **Task topic** | Managing coeliac disease through diet |
| **Task description** | Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, causing damage to the small intestine. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet, including which foods are safe and unsafe, how to prevent cross-contamination, and how to maintain proper nutrition while avoiding gluten. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which grains and foods contain gluten, cross-contamination risks in food preparation, and nutritional considerations for maintaining a balanced gluten-free diet, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about coeliac disease and the gluten-free diet, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to distinguish between safe and unsafe foods based on ingredients and labeling, particularly understanding the difference between "wheat-free" and "gluten-free" claims. 2. How to prevent cross-contamination when preparing meals for someone with coeliac disease in a shared kitchen environment. 3. How to plan nutritionally balanced gluten-free meals that address potential nutrient gaps while incorporating naturally gluten-free whole foods. |
