### Task Instructions

**Task Description (~50 words):**
The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) protects the voting rights of military members, their families, and U.S. citizens living abroad. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about UOCAVA, including who it covers, state obligations for ballot transmission, and how covered voters can ensure their ballots are counted.

**Task Instruction for Explainer:**
You will need to provide clear and accurate information about UOCAVA voting rights to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the 45-day ballot transmission requirement, who qualifies as a covered voter, and how the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot works, so pay attention to these details.

**Task Instruction for Learner:**
Your partner will have gained knowledge about UOCAVA voting protections, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. What to do if you're an overseas citizen who wants to register and vote close to an election deadline. 2. How states must comply with federal ballot transmission requirements even when it conflicts with their normal procedures. 3. What action to take if you're a deployed service member who requested a ballot but it hasn't arrived near election day.

### Familiarity Quiz (FQ1-FQ4)

**FQ1 (Domain-specific, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with common civics terms and definitions such as absentee voting, voter registration, and federal elections?

**FQ2 (Domain-specific, Understanding):**
How well do you understand how federal and state governments share responsibility for administering elections, including which powers belong to each level of government?

**FQ3 (Task-specific, Remembering):**
How familiar are you with terms related to military and overseas voting such as UOCAVA, Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB), and covered voters?

**FQ4 (Task-specific, Understanding):**
