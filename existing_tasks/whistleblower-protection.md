| **Task title** | Whistleblower Protection |
| **Task topic** | OSHA whistleblower protection program |
| **Task description** | OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program enforces over 20 federal laws protecting employees from retaliation for reporting workplace safety violations, financial fraud, and other concerns. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about whistleblower protections, including filing deadlines, types of retaliation, employee coverage, and complaint procedures. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about OSHA's whistleblower protection program to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of filing deadlines for different statutes, what constitutes retaliation, and which employees are covered, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about OSHA's whistleblower protection program, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining the correct filing deadline based on the specific law that was violated. 2. Identifying whether specific employee situations fall under federal OSHA coverage or require state alternatives. 3. Understanding what outcomes to expect from an OSHA investigation and the appeal process. |
