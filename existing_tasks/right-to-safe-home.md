| **Task topic** | California tenant rights to habitable housing |
| **Task description** | California law requires landlords to maintain rental properties in habitable condition, meaning safe and fit to live in. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about tenant rights to a safe home, including what habitability requirements landlords must meet, how to request repairs, and what protections tenants have against retaliation. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about California tenant habitability rights to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what specific conditions landlords must maintain, how tenants should document and request repairs, and what legal protections exist against landlord retaliation, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about California tenant habitability rights, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to properly document and request repairs for unsafe conditions in a rental property. 2. What actions constitute landlord retaliation and what protections tenants have. 3. When and how tenants may be entitled to relocation assistance due to uninhabitable conditions. |
