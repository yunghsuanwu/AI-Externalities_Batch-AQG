| **Task title** | Fundamentals of international law |
| **Task topic** | Fundamentals of international law |
| **Task description** | In political science, international law concerns the formal and informal rules that govern relationships between states and other actors in the international system. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the fundamentals of international law, including its sources, enforcement mechanisms, and key areas of application. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about fundamentals of international law to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the principle of state sovereignty, the distinction between the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), and how treaties create obligations for signatory states, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about fundamentals of international law, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. The difference between ICJ jurisdiction over state disputes and ICC jurisdiction over individual criminal behavior. 2. How signing international treaties affects a state's domestic obligations. 3. The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle and when international intervention may be justified. |
