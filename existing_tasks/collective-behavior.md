| **Task title** | Collective behavior |
| **Task topic** | Collective behavior |
| **Task description** | In sociology, collective behavior refers to noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage, including crowds, masses, and publics. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about collective behavior, including its forms, types of crowds, and the major theoretical perspectives used to analyze it. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about collective behavior to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between crowds, masses, and publics; the stages of value-added theory; and McPhail's assembling perspective categories, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about collective behavior, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between the four types of crowds (casual, conventional, expressive, and acting). 2. Identifying the stages of Smelser's value-added theory in real-world scenarios. 3. Recognizing types of convergent behavior according to McPhail's assembling perspective. |
