| **Task title** | Massage therapy |
| **Task topic** | Massage therapy benefits and evidence |
| **Task description** | Massage therapy is one of the oldest tools humans have used to relieve pain and enhance wellness, practiced across cultures throughout history. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about massage therapy, including its effectiveness for different conditions, the strength of scientific evidence, and important considerations for specific populations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about massage therapy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the evidence strength for different pain conditions, duration requirements for benefits, and special considerations for cancer patients, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about massage therapy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Evaluating whether massage therapy is recommended for specific conditions based on clinical guidelines. 2. Determining how long massage treatment should continue to achieve benefits for chronic conditions. 3. Understanding what modifications may be needed for massage therapy in special populations like cancer patients. |
