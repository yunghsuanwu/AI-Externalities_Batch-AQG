| **Task title** | Adoption Credit |
| **Task topic** | Adoption Credit for qualified adoption expenses |
| **Task description** | The Adoption Credit allows taxpayers who adopt eligible children to claim a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses, with different rules for domestic, foreign, and special needs adoptions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the Adoption Credit, including eligibility requirements, expense limits, timing rules for different adoption types, and how employer benefits coordinate with the credit. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the Adoption Credit to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the maximum expense limits and refundable portions, how timing differs between domestic and foreign adoptions, and how to calculate the credit when prior years' credits have been claimed, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the Adoption Credit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. When to claim expenses for foreign adoptions versus domestic adoptions and how finalization affects timing. 2. How to calculate the remaining credit when adopting the same child over multiple years. 3. How employer-provided adoption benefits affect the credit amount and the order of claiming exclusions versus credits. |
