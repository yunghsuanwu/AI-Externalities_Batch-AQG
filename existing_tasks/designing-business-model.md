| **Task title** | Designing business model |
| **Task topic** | Designing and mapping business models |
| **Task description** | A business model describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about designing business models, including the business model canvas components, value proposition development, and the desirability-feasibility-viability framework. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about business model design to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the nine components of the business model canvas, how to develop a value proposition, and the desirability-feasibility-viability framework, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about designing business models, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify which business model canvas blocks address desirability versus feasibility versus viability. 2. How to apply Maurya's formula to create a value proposition. 3. How to evaluate startup concepts using the appropriate framework components. |
