| **Task title** | Nutrition and Kidney Disease |
| **Task topic** | Nutrition management for chronic kidney disease stages 1-5 |
| **Task description** | Chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires careful dietary management to slow disease progression and maintain overall health. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about nutrition for kidney disease, including which nutrients need to be controlled, why certain foods are recommended or restricted, and how dietary needs change based on kidney function. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about nutrition and kidney disease to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which nutrients CKD patients need to control, why plant proteins are preferred over animal proteins, and how fluid intake relates to kidney function, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about nutrition and kidney disease, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Which specific foods to limit or avoid based on their nutrient content (phosphorus, potassium, sodium). 2. How to identify problematic ingredients on food labels, particularly phosphate additives. 3. How dietary recommendations change based on kidney disease stage and individual factors like diabetes or weight goals. |
