| **Task title** | Logarithms |
| **Task topic** | Logarithms |
| **Task description** | In math, logarithms are exponents that express the power to which a base must be raised to produce a given number. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about logarithms and how to apply their properties to solve equations and simplify expressions. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about logarithms to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the definition and meaning of logarithms, the laws of logarithms (product, quotient, and power rules), and the change-of-base formula, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about logarithms, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Converting between logarithmic and exponential forms. 2. Applying logarithm properties to simplify or combine expressions. 3. Solving equations involving logarithms with different bases. |
| **Formulas** | {"Product Rule": "$\log_b(x_1 x_2) = \log_b x_1 + \log_b x_2$", "Quotient Rule": "$\log_b \frac{x_1}{x_2} = \log_b x_1 - \log_b x_2$", "Power Rule": "$\log_b(x^a) = a \log_b x$", "Change-of-Base Formula": "$(\log_b a)(\log_a x) = \log_b x$"} |
