| **Task title** | Fair Labor Standards Act Exemptions |
| **Task topic** | FLSA white-collar exemptions from overtime pay |
| **Task description** | The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most U.S. employees, while providing exemptions for certain executive, administrative, professional, computer, and outside sales employees. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about these exemptions, how workers of different categories may qualify, and why. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about FLSA exemptions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of salary thresholds and compensation requirements, differences between exemption categories, and which workers are excluded from exemptions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about FLSA exemptions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether a specific employee meets the salary and duty requirements for an exemption. 2. How to distinguish between different exemption categories based on an employee's primary duties, such as those in executive and administrative functions. 3. How categorical exclusions (like blue-collar workers and first responders) override other exemption criteria. |

| **Question** | Participants | Robert is a software engineer earning $720 per week who spends 80% of his time writing code for a company's proprietary inventory management system.

Yes, because he exceeds the salary threshold and primarily designs and develops computer programs", "C. No, because the computer exemption requires employees to work exclusively on computer tasks", "D. Yes, but only if he holds a computer science degree from an accredited university", "E.
