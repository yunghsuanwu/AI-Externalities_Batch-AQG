| **Task title** | Qualified business income deduction |
| **Task topic** | Section 199A qualified business income deduction for pass-through entities |
| **Task description** | The qualified business income (QBI) deduction, also known as the Section 199A deduction, allows eligible owners of pass-through businesses to deduct up to 20 percent of their qualified business income. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the QBI deduction, including eligible business structures, income types that qualify or are excluded, calculation components, and applicable limitations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the qualified business income deduction to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which business structures and income types qualify for the deduction, how the two components (QBI and REIT/PTP) differ in their limitations, and how to calculate the maximum deduction given various income scenarios, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the qualified business income deduction, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which portions of income from mixed sources (wages, partnership profits, guaranteed payments) qualify for the QBI deduction. 2. Understanding how the overall deduction limit based on taxable income and capital gains affects the final deduction amount. 3. Evaluating how changes in business structure (such as converting to a C corporation) affect eligibility for the deduction. |
