| **Task title** | Child tax credit |
| **Task topic** | Child Tax Credit eligibility and amounts |
| **Task description** | The Child Tax Credit helps families reduce their tax liability or receive refunds for qualifying children and dependents. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the Child Tax Credit, including eligibility requirements, credit amounts, and how different credits apply to various family situations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the Child Tax Credit to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of credit amounts and income thresholds, differences between CTC, ACTC, and ODC, and identification requirements for each credit, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the Child Tax Credit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine which credit (CTC, ACTC, or ODC) a child or dependent qualifies for based on age and identification type. 2. How to calculate the maximum credit amount based on income level and number of qualifying children. 3. How refundable and non-refundable credits affect taxpayers with different levels of tax liability. |
