| **Task title** | Data and information extraction |
| **Task topic** | Data and information extraction |
| **Task description** | In computer science, data and information extraction involves processing raw data to reveal meaningful patterns, trends, and insights. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about data and information extraction, including data cleaning, visualization tools, and how predicting algorithms use historical data to forecast future events. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about data and information extraction to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of data cleaning processes, the importance of visualization tools for interpreting data, and how predicting algorithms rely on historical data and trends, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about data and information extraction, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining what questions can or cannot be answered from a given data set. 2. Evaluating which data sources are most useful for specific prediction tasks. 3. Understanding limitations of simulations and models when predicting real-world outcomes. |

| **Question** | Participants | A restaurant chain wanted to reduce wait times at its drive-thru.
