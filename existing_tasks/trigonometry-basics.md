| **Task inspiration** | Trigonometry is a common area taught in high schools and included in AMC; however, it is not a common requirement for SAT or GRE General, reducing the possibility of participants having strong priors. |

| **Task ID** | trigonometry-basics-singleselect |
| **Task title** | Trigonometric functions |
| **Task topic** | Trigonometric functions |
| **Task scenario** | You are assisting a student learning about fundamental math topics that bridges between high-school and university. One of the topic is trigonometric functions. |
| **Task description** | In math, trigonometry concerns the relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about fundamental trigonometric functions and how to apply them to triangles to solve problems. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about fundamental trigonometric functions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the relationships between different functions and some special triangles, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about fundamental trigonometric functions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Special right triangle with angles like 30-60-90. 2. Isosceles right triangles (right triangles with two equal sides). 3. Relationships between trigonometric functions. |
| **Formulas** | {"Sine (right triangle)": "$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$", "Cosine (right triangle)": "$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$"} |
