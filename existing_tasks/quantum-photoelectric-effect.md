| **Task title** | Quantum phenomenon and photoelectric effect |
| **Task topic** | Quantum phenomenon and photoelectric effect |
| **Task description** | In physics, quantum phenomena describe how energy and matter behave at the smallest scales, where quantities come in discrete packets. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about quantum phenomenon and the photoelectric effect, including how light interacts with metals to release electrons. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about quantum phenomenon and the photoelectric effect to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the relationship between photon energy and frequency, the concept of threshold frequency, and how light intensity affects electron emission, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about quantum phenomenon and the photoelectric effect, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. The relationship between photon energy, frequency, and wavelength using Planck's constant. 2. How threshold frequency determines whether electrons are emitted from a metal surface. 3. The effect of light intensity versus light frequency on the number and kinetic energy of emitted electrons. |
