| **Task description** | In psychology, the stage theory of memory describes how information flows through distinct memory systems, each with unique characteristics and functions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the stage theory of memory and how different memory types store and process information. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the stage theory of memory to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between sensory, short-term, and long-term memory, the distinction between episodic and semantic memory, and rehearsal strategies like maintenance and chunking, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the stage theory of memory, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying which memory system is being used in real-world scenarios. 2. Distinguishing between types of declarative memory (episodic vs. semantic). 3. Recognizing different memory strategies such as maintenance rehearsal, elaborative rehearsal, and chunking. |
