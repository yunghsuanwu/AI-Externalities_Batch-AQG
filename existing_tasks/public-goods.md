| **Task topic** | Public goods |
| **Task description** | In economics, public goods are a category of goods with unique characteristics that distinguish them from private goods and create challenges for market provision. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about public goods, their defining features, and why governments often provide them instead of private markets. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about public goods to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the two defining characteristics of public goods (nonexcludable and non-rival), the free rider problem, and the tragedy of the commons, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about public goods, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying whether specific goods are public goods based on excludability and rivalry. 2. Understanding why governments provide certain goods instead of private markets. 3. Distinguishing between public goods and common resources (tragedy of the commons). |
