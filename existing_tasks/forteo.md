| **Task title** | Forteo |
| **Task topic** | Using FORTEO for osteoporosis treatment |
| **Task description** | FORTEO (teriparatide) is a prescription injectable medication used to treat osteoporosis in patients at high risk for fractures. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about FORTEO, including its proper administration, storage requirements, potential side effects, and important safety warnings. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about FORTEO to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of proper injection technique and sites, storage and handling requirements, and recognizing serious side effects like hypercalcemia symptoms, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about FORTEO, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine if medication that has been improperly stored or appears abnormal is safe to use. 2. How to recognize and respond to common early side effects versus symptoms requiring medical attention. 3. How treatment duration limitations and patient medical history affect FORTEO eligibility. |
