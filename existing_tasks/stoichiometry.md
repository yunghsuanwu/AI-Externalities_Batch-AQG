| **Task title** | Chemical reactions and stoichiometry |
| **Task topic** | Chemical reactions and stoichiometry |
| **Task description** | In chemistry, stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to calculate the quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about chemical reactions and stoichiometry and how to apply them to solve quantitative chemistry problems. You might encounter the concept of 'mole' (mol), which is a unit representing a specific number of particles (6.022 × 10^23). You should also know common notations for different states of matter: (g) = gas, (l) = liquid, (s) = solid |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about chemical reactions and stoichiometry to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of balancing chemical equations, identifying limiting reagents, and calculating percent yield, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about chemical reactions and stoichiometry, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying whether an equation is balanced. 2. Determining limiting reagents when given amounts of multiple reactants. 3. Calculating theoretical and percent yield of products. |
