| **Task topic** | Competitive analysis for entrepreneurial ventures |
| **Task description** | A competitive analysis helps entrepreneurs determine whether their business idea is viable within a specific market by examining competitors, identifying gaps, and developing sustainable advantages. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about competitive analysis and common tools used to identify key success factors in an industry. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about competitive analysis to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the components of SWOT and PEST analyses, how to construct and interpret a competitive analysis grid, and how to distinguish between internal and external factors affecting a business, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about competitive analysis, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate a business's competitive position using SWOT analysis by correctly categorizing factors as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats. 2. How to interpret a competitive analysis grid to identify market gaps and key success factors. 3. How to apply PEST analysis to identify external factors that could impact a new venture. |
