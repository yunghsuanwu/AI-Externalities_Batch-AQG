| **Task title** | Autonomous systems of the internet |
| **Task topic** | Autonomous systems of the internet |
| **Task description** | In computer science, autonomous systems of the internet refer to the interconnected networks, protocols, and devices that enable global communication and data transmission. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about autonomous systems of the internet, including how data travels across networks and the protocols that govern this process. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about autonomous systems of the internet to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between TCP, UDP, and IP protocols, how fault tolerance and redundancy work in networks, and how data packets are routed through network paths, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about autonomous systems of the internet, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying which protocols handle specific functions (addressing, routing, packet transmission). 2. Analyzing network diagrams to find paths between devices. 3. Understanding how redundancy and fault tolerance affect network reliability. |
