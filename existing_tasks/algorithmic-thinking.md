| **Task title** | Algorithmic thinking |
| **Task topic** | Algorithmic thinking |
| **Task description** | n computer science, algorithmic thinking involves understanding how to design and analyze step-by-step procedures for solving problems. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the definition, properties, and execution of algorithms, and how to trace through algorithm steps to determine their outputs. Note: 'mod' refers to the modulo operation, which returns the remainder after division (e.g., 7 mod 2 = 1 because 7 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1). |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about algorithmic thinking to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the definition and required properties of algorithms, how to trace through conditional statements and loops, and how to read different algorithmic expressions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about algorithmic thinking, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Tracing algorithm execution with conditional statements (if/else) and while loops. 2. Determining output sequences when given specific input values. 3. Understanding algorithm termination conditions and loop behavior. |
