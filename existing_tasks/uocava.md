| **Task title** | Uniformed And Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act |
| **Task topic** | UOCAVA voting rights for military and overseas citizens |
| **Task description** | The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) is a federal law that protects the voting rights of U.S. military personnel, their families, and citizens living abroad. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about UOCAVA, including who is covered by the law, the specific deadlines and procedures for absentee voting, and the tools available to ensure overseas voters can participate in federal elections. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about UOCAVA to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the categories of citizens protected under UOCAVA, the specific deadlines for ballot transmission and registration requests, and the purpose and use of the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about UOCAVA, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine which ballot to submit if both a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot and a state-issued ballot are received. 2. What remedies are available when states fail to send ballots to UOCAVA voters on time. 3. How to identify whether specific individuals qualify for UOCAVA protections based on their circumstances. |
