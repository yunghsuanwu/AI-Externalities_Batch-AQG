| **Task title** | Unemployment insurance |
| **Task topic** | Unemployment insurance eligibility and benefits |
| **Task description** | Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a joint state-federal program providing temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about unemployment insurance, including eligibility requirements, how to apply and maintain benefits, and reasons benefits may be denied. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about unemployment insurance to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of eligibility requirements and the base period, how to file and maintain weekly claims, and reasons for benefit denial and the appeals process, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about unemployment insurance, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether someone qualifies for UI benefits based on their specific employment situation and separation circumstances. 2. Understanding what actions are required to maintain eligibility while receiving benefits. 3. Evaluating whether a denial of benefits is legitimate and what options exist for appeal. |

| **Question** | Participants | Marcus was laid off from his warehouse job due to the company relocating operations overseas.

Decline the offer without reporting it, since part-time work does not count as suitable employment", "C.

Accept the job but continue collecting full benefits without reporting the earnings"] |

| **Question** | Participants | Priya quit her customer service job after her employer reduced her hours from 40 to 15 per week and reassigned her to overnight shifts without notice.

File an appeal within the established time frame, as benefits may be paid for quitting under certain circumstances", "C. Reapply for benefits using a different reason for separation to avoid the denial", "D. Wait 26 weeks and then file a new claim as a first-time applicant", "E. Contact her former employer to request they change the separation reason on record"] |
