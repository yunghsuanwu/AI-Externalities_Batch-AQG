| **Task topic** | Safe computing |
| **Task description** | In computer science, safe computing concerns the protection of devices, data, and personal information from unauthorized access and cyber threats. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about safe computing practices, including authentication methods, encryption types, and common cyber attacks. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about safe computing to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of types of cyber attacks (such as phishing, keylogging, and rogue access points), encryption methods, and the distinction between security and privacy, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about safe computing, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying different types of cyber attacks in real-world scenarios (e.g., phishing vs rogue access points). 2. Distinguishing between security concerns and privacy concerns. 3. Recognizing legitimate communications versus phishing attempts. |
