| **Task title** | The Mongol Empire |
| **Task topic** | The Mongol Empire |
| **Task description** | The Mongol Empire, founded by Genghis Khan in the 13th century, became the largest contiguous land empire in history, dramatically altering interactions between Europe and Asia. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the Mongol Empire, including its conquests, administration across different regions, and lasting historical impacts. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the Mongol Empire to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of Mongol military tactics and conquests, the impact of Mongol rule on Russia and China, and the spread of the Black Death through trade routes, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the Mongol Empire, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How Mongol rule affected different conquered regions in distinct ways, as well as which regions the Mongols failed to conquer despite multiple attempts. 2. The broader consequences of increased trade and connectivity during the Mongol period, in the context of the Black Death. 3. Strategic military considerations for dynasties dealing with Mongol threats after the empire's decline. |
