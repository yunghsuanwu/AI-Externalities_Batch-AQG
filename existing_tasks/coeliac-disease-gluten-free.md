| **Task ID** | coeliac-disease-gluten-free |
| **Task title** | Coeliac Disease and Gluten Free Diet |
| **Task topic** | Managing coeliac disease through gluten-free diet |
| **Task description** | Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition affecting around 1 in 100 people, requiring strict lifelong avoidance of gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about coeliac disease, including its diagnosis, safe food identification, and practical management strategies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about coeliac disease and gluten-free diets to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of diagnostic testing requirements, identifying safe ingredients on food labels, and preventing cross-contamination, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about coeliac disease and gluten-free diets, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to prevent cross-contamination when preparing gluten-free food at home. 2. What steps to take before and during coeliac disease testing to ensure accurate results. 3. How to identify safe dining options when eating out with coeliac disease. |
