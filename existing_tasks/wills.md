| **Task title** | Wills |
| **Task topic** | Virginia will law and estate planning |
| **Task description** | Wills are legal documents that direct how a person's property is distributed after death. Each state has specific requirements for valid wills. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Virginia will law, including who can make a will, formal requirements, what happens without a will, and how life changes affect existing wills. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Virginia will law to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of witness and notarization requirements, intestate succession rules for blended families, and how marriage or divorce affects existing wills, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Virginia will law, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. What specific provisions a will can include to protect minor children in blended family situations. 2. How to calculate the distribution of an estate when someone dies without a will, considering different family structures. 3. What happens to an existing will when major life events like marriage or divorce occur. |
