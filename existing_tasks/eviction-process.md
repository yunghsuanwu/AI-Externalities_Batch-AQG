| **Task title** | Eviction process |
| **Task topic** | California tenant eviction rights and procedures |
| **Task description** | California tenants have specific legal protections during evictions, including required written notices, court procedures, and deadlines for responding. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the eviction process, including notice requirements, how to calculate deadlines, and what actions tenants must take to protect their rights. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the California eviction process to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of different types of eviction notices and their deadlines, how to calculate response periods, and what happens if tenants miss court deadlines, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the California eviction process, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to calculate deadlines for different types of eviction notices, including which days to count or skip. 2. What specific actions a tenant should take when receiving court documents to avoid losing the case automatically. 3. How to determine the correct response when a landlord attempts illegal eviction methods. |
