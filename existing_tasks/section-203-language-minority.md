| **Task topic** | Voting protections for language minority citizens under Section 203 |
| **Task description** | Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act protects the voting rights of citizens with limited-English proficiency by requiring certain jurisdictions to provide election materials and assistance in languages other than English. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Section 203, including which language groups are covered, what jurisdictions must do to comply, and how bilingual election programs are implemented. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which language minority groups are protected, how jurisdictions are determined to be covered, and what materials and assistance must be provided, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How election officials should determine what language assistance to provide at specific polling locations. 2. What steps a covered jurisdiction should take to ensure translated materials meet legal requirements. 3. What community members or officials should do when Section 203 compliance problems arise. |
