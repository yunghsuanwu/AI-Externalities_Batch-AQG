| **Task topic** | Common business failures |
| **Task description** | Business failure is a common challenge that entrepreneurs face, with many startups failing within their first few years due to mistakes in marketing, management, finances, and innovation. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the common reasons businesses fail and strategies to prevent these failures. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about business failures to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the different categories of business failure, how marketing missteps lead to failure, and how lack of planning affects business survival, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about business failures, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify which type of failure (marketing, management, financial, or innovation) is affecting a business and what steps to take. 2. How founder conflicts and lack of formal agreements can be addressed. 3. How businesses can avoid innovation failures by adapting to changing markets. |
