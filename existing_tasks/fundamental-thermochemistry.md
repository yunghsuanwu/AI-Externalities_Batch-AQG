| **Task description** | In chemistry, thermochemistry concerns the study of heat energy associated with chemical reactions and changes of state. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about fundamentals of thermochemistry and how to apply them to analyze chemical reactions. You might encounter the concept of 'mole' (mol), which is a unit representing a specific number of particles (6.022 × 10^23). |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about fundamentals of thermochemistry to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of entropy and enthalpy definitions, the relationship between disorder and states of matter, and calculating heats of reaction using heats of formation, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about fundamentals of thermochemistry, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether entropy increases or decreases in a reaction based on states of matter. 2. Calculating heat of reaction using heats of formation. 3. Applying Hess's law to find enthalpy changes when reactions occur in multiple steps. |
