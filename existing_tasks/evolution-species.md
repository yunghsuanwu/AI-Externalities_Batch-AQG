| **Task topic** | Evolution and species |
| **Task description** | In biology, evolution explains how populations change over time through genetic variation and natural selection, sometimes leading to the formation of new species. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about evolution and species, including the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change and the evidence used to trace evolutionary relationships. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about evolution and species to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between divergent and convergent evolution, how to distinguish homologous from analogous structures, and the conditions required for speciation to occur, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about evolution and species, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying whether a scenario represents divergent or convergent evolution. 2. Determining whether similar structures between species are homologous or analogous. 3. Recognizing what mechanisms lead to speciation in separated populations. |
