| **Task title** | Uniform Electric Fields |
| **Task topic** | Uniform Electric Fields |
| **Task description** | In physics, uniform electric fields describe the constant electric field that exists between two parallel charged plates, creating predictable forces on charged particles. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about uniform electric fields and how to apply related concepts to solve problems involving charges and forces. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about uniform electric fields to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the direction of electric fields and forces on different charges, the relationship between electric force and field strength, and the behavior of subatomic particles in fields, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about uniform electric fields, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating electric field strength given force and charge values. 2. Comparing the motion of subatomic particles between charged plates. 3. Determining charge magnitude when objects are suspended motionless in electric fields. |
