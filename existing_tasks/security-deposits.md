| **Task topic** | California tenant security deposit rights |
| **Task description** | California has strict laws governing how landlords must handle tenant security deposits, including limits on amounts, allowed deductions, and return timelines. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about security deposit regulations, including deposit limits, allowable deductions, inspection rights, and landlord obligations after move-out. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about California security deposit laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of deposit amount limits, what landlords can and cannot deduct, and the timeline and procedures for returning deposits, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about California security deposit laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a landlord's deduction from a security deposit is legally permitted or prohibited. 2. Evaluating whether a landlord has met the legal requirements for returning a deposit after move-out. 3. Understanding what remedies are available when a landlord violates security deposit laws. |
