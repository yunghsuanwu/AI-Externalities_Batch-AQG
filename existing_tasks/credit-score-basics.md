| **Task topic** | Understanding credit scores and how they work |
| **Task description** | Credit scores are numerical representations of your financial history that lenders use to make decisions about loans, credit cards, and interest rates. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about credit scores, including what factors determine them, how different scoring models work, and how your financial behaviors affect your score. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about credit scores to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how credit scores are calculated, what factors carry the most weight in scoring models, and how different types of credit affect scores, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about credit scores, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to interpret credit score ranges and what they mean for loan eligibility and interest rates. 2. Which financial behaviors have the greatest impact on credit scores and why. 3. How to evaluate the differences between scoring models like FICO and VantageScore when assessing your credit health. |

| **Question** | Participants | Chen is 22 years old and just got his first credit card six months ago. He pays his balance in full each month and stays well below his credit limit.

His short length of credit history limits his score in that category", "D. Staying below the credit limit counts against utilization in scoring models", "E. Credit scores cannot increase until a person reaches age 25"] |
