| **Task topic** | Debt avalanche vs. debt snowball methods |
| **Task description** | Paying off debt requires choosing a strategy that fits your financial personality and situation. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about debt repayment strategies, including how the debt avalanche and debt snowball methods work, their benefits and drawbacks, and how to choose between them based on individual circumstances. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about debt repayment strategies to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how the debt avalanche and snowball methods prioritize payments, the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and factors that influence which method to choose, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about debt repayment strategies, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine which debt repayment method aligns with a person's financial personality and goals. 2. When it makes sense to switch strategies or modify your approach for different types of debt like student loans. 3. How to evaluate whether to continue aggressive debt repayment or redirect funds to investments once high-APR debt is eliminated. |

| **Question** | Participants | Priya has paid off all her credit cards and now has only two remaining debts: a car loan at 5% APR with $12,000 remaining, and a mortgage at 4% APR.

Switch to the snowball method and pay off whichever loan has the smaller balance", "C. Make minimum payments on both loans and invest extra cash in the 401(k)", "D.

| **Question** | Participants | David is choosing between the debt avalanche and debt snowball methods. He has four debts with the following balances and APRs: $500 at 24% APR, $3,000 at 22% APR, $2,800 at 19% APR, and $2,900 at 17% APR. He values efficiency and saving money over quick emotional wins. Which method should David choose, and why does his specific debt profile make this choice particularly clear? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Debt snowball, because the smallest debt will be eliminated quickly regardless of method", "B. Debt avalanche, because his smallest balance also has the highest APR, so both methods would start with the same debt", "C. Debt snowball, because his balances are too similar for the avalanche method to provide meaningful savings", "D. Debt avalanche, because his highest-APR debt has the largest balance, maximizing interest savings", "E. Neither method, because he should consolidate all debts first given how similar the balances are"] |
