| **Task title** | Workplace Discrimination |
| **Task topic** | Federal workplace discrimination laws and protections |
| **Task description** | Federal laws protect employees from discrimination based on characteristics like race, sex, age, disability, and more. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about workplace discrimination, including who is protected, what practices are prohibited, and how to file complaints. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about workplace discrimination laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which groups are legally protected, how retaliation protections work, and differences between laws for federal contractors versus other employers, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about workplace discrimination laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a specific worker qualifies for protection under age or other discrimination laws. 2. Identifying what type of discrimination has occurred when an employer takes adverse action against an employee. 3. Evaluating whether an employer's refusal to provide accommodation is legally justified. |
