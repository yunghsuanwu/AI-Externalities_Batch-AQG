| **Task description** | Self-employment tax is a combination of Social Security and Medicare taxes that self-employed individuals must pay on their net earnings. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about self-employment tax, including the current tax rates and thresholds, how the wage base limit works, and how Additional Medicare Tax applies to high earners. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about self-employment tax to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the self-employment tax rate and its components, how the Social Security wage base affects calculations, and when Additional Medicare Tax applies, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about self-employment tax, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating self-employment tax when income exceeds the Social Security wage base. 2. Determining Additional Medicare Tax obligations based on filing status and income level. 3. Understanding how wage income and self-employment income interact for Social Security tax purposes. |
