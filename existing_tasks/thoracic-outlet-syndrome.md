| **Task title** | Thoracic Outlet Syndrome |
| **Task topic** | Thoracic outlet syndrome types, symptoms, and causes |
| **Task description** | Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions caused by compression of blood vessels or nerves between the neck and shoulder. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about thoracic outlet syndrome, including the three types of TOS, their distinct symptoms, causes and risk factors, and prevention strategies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about thoracic outlet syndrome to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the three types of TOS and their symptoms, risk factors and causes such as anatomy and trauma, and prevention strategies, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about thoracic outlet syndrome, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify which type of TOS a person might have based on their specific symptoms. 2. Why symptoms from a traumatic event like a car accident might appear weeks later. 3. What lifestyle changes can prevent or reduce the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome. |

Traumatic events cause internal changes that compress nerves with delayed symptom onset", "C. Scar tissue from the accident takes time to form and cause compression", "D. Psychological denial prevents recognition of symptoms until later", "E. Swelling must first subside before nerve compression can occur"] |
