| **Task ID** | unemployment-rate |
| **Task title** | Unemployment rate |
| **Task topic** | Unemployment rate |
| **Task description** | In economics, the unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking but unable to find work. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about how unemployment is defined, calculated, and interpreted, including its limitations as a measure of joblessness. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about unemployment rate concepts to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the distinction between unemployed and out of the labor force, the formula for calculating unemployment rate, and the concept of hidden unemployment, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about unemployment rate, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate from population data. 2. Identifying who counts as unemployed versus out of the labor force in various scenarios. 3. Understanding limitations of the official unemployment rate, including discouraged workers and hidden unemployment. |
