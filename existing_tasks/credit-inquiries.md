| **Task topic** | Hard and soft credit inquiries and their effects |
| **Task description** | Credit inquiries occur whenever your credit information is accessed, but not all inquiries affect your credit score the same way. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the differences between hard and soft credit inquiries, including when each type occurs, how long they remain on your credit report, and strategies for minimizing their impact. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about hard and soft credit inquiries to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between hard and soft inquiries, how long inquiries stay on credit reports, and rate-shopping strategies, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about hard and soft credit inquiries, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether a specific credit-related action will result in a hard or soft inquiry. 2. How to minimize the credit score impact when shopping for loans. 3. How to respond appropriately when discovering unfamiliar hard inquiries on your credit report. |
