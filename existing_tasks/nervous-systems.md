| **Task ID** | nervous-systems |
| **Task title** | Peripheral and central nervous systems |
| **Task topic** | Peripheral and central nervous systems |
| **Task description** | In psychology, the nervous system is the body's communication network that controls both voluntary and involuntary functions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the peripheral and central nervous systems and how their subdivisions work together to regulate behavior and bodily responses. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the peripheral and central nervous systems to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the functions of afferent and efferent pathways, and the components of the central nervous system, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the peripheral and central nervous systems, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying which nervous system (sympathetic vs. parasympathetic) is activated in specific scenarios like stress or rest. 2. Understanding the physiological effects of each autonomic subdivision (heart rate, digestion, pupil response). 3. Distinguishing between the roles of the central and peripheral nervous systems and their components. |
