| **Task title** | Inflation rate |
| **Task topic** | Inflation rate |
| **Task description** | In economics, inflation refers to a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices across an entire economy. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about how economists measure and calculate inflation rates using price indices and baskets of goods. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about inflation rates and price indices to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how to calculate inflation rates from price levels, how index numbers and base years work, and the distinction between price levels and inflation rates, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about inflation rates and price indices, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating inflation rates from basket of goods prices across different time periods. 2. Converting spending amounts to index numbers using a base year. 3. Computing percentage changes in price levels between years. |

| **Question** | Participants | Why do economists report price levels as index numbers rather than dollar amounts? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Index numbers are required by government statistical agencies", "B. Index numbers make it easier to quickly see percentage changes across periods", "C. Dollar amounts cannot be calculated for large baskets of goods", "D. Dollar amounts fluctuate too frequently based on market prices, making price levels hard to track", "E. Index numbers eliminate the need to select a base year, allowing for universal comparison of price levels"] |
