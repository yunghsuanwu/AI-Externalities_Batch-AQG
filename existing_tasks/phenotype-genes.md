| **Task topic** | Phenotype and genes |
| **Task description** | In biology, genetics concerns how traits are inherited from parents to offspring through genes. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about phenotype and genes, including how different allele combinations determine an organism's observable traits. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about phenotype and genes to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between dominant and recessive alleles, how to predict offspring phenotypes from crosses, and patterns of inheritance like incomplete dominance, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about phenotype and genes, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Predicting phenotype ratios from crosses between heterozygous organisms. 2. Distinguishing between complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance. 3. Determining genotypes based on observed phenotypes in offspring. |
