| **Task topic** | Secured and unsecured credit cards |
| **Task description** | Secured and unsecured credit cards are two common types of credit cards with different requirements, benefits, and ideal use cases. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about secured and unsecured credit cards, including how security deposits work, which card type suits different credit situations, and how to upgrade from secured to unsecured cards. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about secured and unsecured credit cards to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how security deposits function as collateral, when each card type is appropriate based on credit history, and the process for upgrading from a secured to unsecured card, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about secured and unsecured credit cards, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which card type is appropriate for someone based on their specific credit situation and financial goals. 2. Understanding how actions like payment history and credit utilization affect upgrade eligibility. 3. Evaluating the trade-offs between card features when deciding between secured and unsecured options. |

| **Question** | Participants | David has an established credit history with a score of 740 and steady income. He is deciding between a secured card with 2% cash back rewards and no annual fee, and an unsecured card with 1.5% cash back, a $95 annual fee, but a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases.
