| **Task topic** | Understanding 529 education savings plans |
| **Task description** | 529 plans are tax-advantaged savings plans designed to encourage saving for future education costs. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about 529 plans, including the differences between education savings plans and prepaid tuition plans, qualified expense limits, investment restrictions, and how guarantees work. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about 529 plans to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of qualified expense limits for K-12 and loan repayments, differences between education savings plans and prepaid tuition plans, and investment option restrictions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about 529 plans, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate whether to change investment options based on time horizon and market conditions. 2. What happens to prepaid tuition plan credits when a beneficiary attends a non-participating school. 3. How to maximize 529 funds for different qualified expenses including loans and K-12 tuition. |
