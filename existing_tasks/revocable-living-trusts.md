| **Task topic** | Revocable living trusts in estate planning |
| **Task description** | A revocable living trust is a legal arrangement that allows individuals to manage their assets during their lifetime and transfer them privately after death, potentially avoiding probate. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about revocable living trusts, including how they work, who manages them, and how they compare to wills. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about revocable living trusts to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of who serves as trustee and when successor trustees take over, which assets are typically included or excluded from trusts, and the advantages and disadvantages compared to wills, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about revocable living trusts, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate whether a revocable living trust or will better meets specific estate planning goals such as privacy and incapacity management. 2. How to assess common misconceptions about tax advantages of trusts versus wills. 3. How to recognize that estate planning recommendations may vary significantly by state. |

| **Question** | Participants | Robert has a net estate valued at $1.5 million and lives in Washington state.
