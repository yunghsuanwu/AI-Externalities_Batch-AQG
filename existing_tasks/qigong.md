| **Task description** | Qigong is a 4,000-year-old traditional Chinese medicine practice that combines intentional movement, meditation, and breathing techniques. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about qigong, including its theoretical foundations, potential health benefits, and how to get started with the practice. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about qigong to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the theoretical basis of qigong and qi, the conditions qigong may help with, and how to find or start qigong practice, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about qigong, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate the current scientific evidence on qigong's health benefits. 2. What questions to ask when considering a qigong class or instructor. 3. How to safely start qigong practice given individual health circumstances. |
