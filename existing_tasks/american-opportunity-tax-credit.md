| **Task description** | The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) provides up to $2,500 per year for qualified higher education expenses during the first four years of post-secondary education. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the AOTC, including eligibility requirements, income limits, and how to properly claim the credit. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the American Opportunity Tax Credit to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of student eligibility requirements, income thresholds for claiming the credit, and the required forms and documentation, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a specific student qualifies for AOTC based on enrollment status, prior credit claims, and education level. 2. Calculating whether a taxpayer can claim the full, partial, or no credit based on their income. 3. Identifying what documentation and forms are needed, including situations where Form 1098-T may not be required. |

| **Question** | Participants | The AOTC is calculated as 100% of the first $2,000 of qualified expenses plus 25% of the next $2,000. Why does this formula result in a maximum credit of $2,500 rather than $4,000? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Because the IRS caps all education credits at $2,500 regardless of calculation", "B. Because only 25% of the second $2,000 is credited, adding $500 to the initial $2,000", "C. Because the credit phases out after the first $2,000 of expenses", "D. Because the remaining $1,500 can only be claimed in future tax years", "E. Because the 25% applies to all $4,000 of expenses, not just the second portion"] |

Because institutions are not required to furnish Form 1098-T in certain circumstances, such as when the student is a qualified nonresident alien", "C. Because Form 1098-T is optional for all students claiming less than $1,000 in expenses", "D. Because online courses are exempt from Form 1098-T requirements", "E. Because Form 1098-T is only needed when claiming the full $2,500 credit"] |
