| **Task title** | Blood in the circulatory system |
| **Task topic** | Blood in the circulatory system |
| **Task description** | In biology, blood is a vital fluid that circulates through the body, transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about blood, including its components, their functions, and how they work together to maintain health and fight disease. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about blood to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the composition and percentages of blood components, the roles of B-cells and T-cells in immunity, and the process of blood clotting, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about blood, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How iron deficiency affects hemoglobin production and causes symptoms like fatigue. 2. The differences between B-cells and T-cells and their roles in immune response. 3. How vaccination affects the immune system's response to subsequent infections. |

| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Patient A will produce antibodies more slowly because the vaccine weakened their immune system.", "B. Patient B will respond faster because their B-cells have not been previously exhausted.", "C. Patient A will respond faster and more strongly because some B-cells from the vaccination remain and can quickly produce specific antibodies.", "D. Both patients will respond at the same rate because antibodies only form after symptoms appear.", "E. Patient B will produce more antibodies because their immune system has more available B-cells."] |
