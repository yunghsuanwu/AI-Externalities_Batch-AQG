| **Task description** | In math, logic (or propositional calculus) is a formal system for reasoning about statements that can be evaluated as true or false using algebraic tools and connectives. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about propositional logic and how to apply logical rules and theorems to evaluate and manipulate compound statements. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about propositional logic to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of logical connectives and their symbols, fundamental theorems like de Morgan's Laws and the contradiction theorem, and how to determine logical equivalence, so pay attention to these details.|
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about propositional logic, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Matching logical symbols to their corresponding operations (negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional). 2. Applying de Morgan's Laws and the contradiction theorem to transform statements. 3. Determining whether compound statements are logically equivalent or identifying tautologies. |
