| **Task title** | Wage Garnishment Protection |
| **Task topic** | CCPA protections for wage garnishment |
| **Task description** | Wage garnishment is a legal procedure through which a portion of a person's earnings is withheld to pay a debt. The Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) sets federal limits on how much can be garnished and provides job protection for workers. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about wage garnishment protections, including calculation thresholds, different rules for different debt types, and how various forms of compensation are treated. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about wage garnishment protection under the CCPA to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the specific dollar thresholds and percentages for garnishment limits, how child support garnishments differ from ordinary debt garnishments, and how tips and lump-sum payments are treated as earnings, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about wage garnishment protection, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine the maximum garnishment amount when someone's income falls between the protected threshold and the 25% limit. 2. How to calculate garnishment limits for child support when the worker has different family situations or is behind on payments. 3. How to identify what counts as "earnings" under the CCPA when someone receives tips, bonuses, or other non-standard compensation. |
