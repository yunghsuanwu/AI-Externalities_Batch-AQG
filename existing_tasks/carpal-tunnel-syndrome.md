| **Task title** | Carpal tunnel syndrome |
| **Task topic** | Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, causes, and prevention |
| **Task description** | Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions, caused by pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about carpal tunnel syndrome, including its symptoms, causes, risk factors, and prevention strategies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about carpal tunnel syndrome to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which fingers are affected and why, what conditions increase risk of carpal tunnel syndrome, and how to prevent or reduce symptoms through workplace adjustments, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about carpal tunnel syndrome, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to recognize whether symptoms match the pattern of carpal tunnel syndrome versus other conditions. 2. How workplace factors and health conditions combine to increase risk. 3. What specific adjustments to keyboard height, wrist position, and work habits can help prevent symptoms. |
