| **Task description** | The Byzantine Empire was the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire that flourished for over a thousand years after Rome's fall. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the Byzantine Empire, including its geography, leadership, religious developments, and lasting contributions. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the Byzantine Empire to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the relationship between religious and political authority, the causes and consequences of the Great Schism, and Emperor Justinian's legal reforms, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the Byzantine Empire, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How the relationship between church and state differed between the Byzantine Empire and Western Europe. 2. The long-term effects of the First Crusade on the Byzantine Empire. 3. How Justinian's approach to legal reform (the Corpus Juris Civilis) could be applied as a model for other rulers. |
