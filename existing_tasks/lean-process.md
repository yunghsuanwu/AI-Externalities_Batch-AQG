| **Task topic** | Lean problem-solving methodology for business improvement |
| **Task description** | Lean process is a systematic methodology pioneered by Toyota for maximizing continuous improvement and minimizing waste in business operations. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about lean process, including the eight-step Toyota problem-solving framework, the three phases of lean problem-solving, and how to apply these principles to identify and eliminate inefficiencies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about lean process to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the eight steps in Toyota's lean problem-solving process, the meaning of key concepts like genchi genbutsu and value streams, and how to identify waste in business processes, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about lean process, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to apply lean principles to diagnose process inefficiencies in specific business scenarios. 2. Which step in the Toyota process to use when you have identified a problem but need to determine its underlying cause. 3. How to evaluate whether steps in a process add value or represent waste that should be eliminated. |

| **Question** | Participants | New Balance originally organized production by departments, with all cutting in one area and all stitching in another. They reorganized so that one side of the floor handled products using US-sourced leather and mesh, while another side handled products using premade overseas components.

It increases inventory between departments to prevent production shortages", "C. It extends production timelines to allow for more careful craftsmanship", "D.
