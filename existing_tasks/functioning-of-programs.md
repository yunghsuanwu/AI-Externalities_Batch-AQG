| **Task description** | In computer science, programs perform specific tasks when run by a computer, processing various forms of input to produce outputs. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about how computer programs function, including their structure, input/output handling, and development processes. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | ou will need to provide clear and accurate information about the functioning of computer programs to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the definitions of programs and code segments, how programs handle different types of input and events, and the importance of procedures and debugging in program development, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the functioning of computer programs, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between programs, code segments, and software specifications. 2. Understanding how events and different input types (tactile, audio, visual, text) affect program execution. 3. Identifying when procedures work correctly versus when they contain logical errors through test cases. |
