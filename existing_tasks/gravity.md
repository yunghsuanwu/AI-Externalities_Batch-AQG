| **Task title** | Gravity |
| **Task topic** | Gravity and gravitational field |
| **Task description** | In physics, gravity is the fundamental force of attraction between objects with mass, governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about gravity and gravitational fields and how to apply related formulas to solve problems involving planets and celestial bodies. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about gravity and gravitational fields to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of Newton's law of universal gravitation, the inverse-square relationship between force and distance, and how to calculate surface gravity for different planets, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about gravity and gravitational fields, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating how gravitational force changes when mass or distance is modified. 2. Determining surface gravity for planets with different masses and radii. 3. Understanding which factors affect gravitational acceleration (and which do not). |
