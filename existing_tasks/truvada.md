| **Task title** | Truvada |
| **Task topic** | Truvada medication for HIV treatment and prevention |
| **Task description** | Truvada is an FDA-approved prescription medication used for HIV treatment and HIV prevention (PrEP). In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Truvada, including its approved uses, required precautions before starting treatment, proper administration, and potential side effects. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Truvada to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of weight requirements for different uses, HIV testing requirements for PrEP, and what to do about missed doses, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Truvada, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine if someone meets the eligibility criteria for Truvada based on weight and HIV status. 2. What actions to take when doses are missed or concerning symptoms develop during treatment. 3. Why Truvada must be used in combination with other HIV medicines for treatment but not for prevention. |
