| **Task title** | Atomic Structure and Mass |
| **Task topic** | Atomic Structure and Mass |
| **Task description** | In chemistry, atomic structure concerns the composition of atoms, including subatomic particles and their properties. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about atomic structure and mass, including how protons, neutrons, and electrons determine an element's identity and characteristics. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about atomic structure and mass to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of subatomic particle properties, isotopes and their notation, and calculating average atomic mass, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about atomic structure and mass, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a specific atom or ion. 2. Understanding isotope notation and how isotopes differ from each other. 3. Calculating average atomic mass from isotope abundances. |
