| **Task topic** | Compound interest and savings growth |
| **Task description** | Compound interest is a powerful tool that allows your money to grow by earning interest not only on your initial deposit but also on previously earned interest. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about compound interest, including how it is calculated, how principal and interest interact over time, and factors that affect savings growth. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about compound interest to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the difference between principal and interest, how compound interest is calculated month over month, and factors that influence how fast savings grow, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about compound interest, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to calculate the interest earned in a given month when you know the principal and interest rate. 2. How to determine a new account balance after multiple compounding periods. 3. How to evaluate which factors (time, interest rate, or principal) will have the greatest impact on savings growth in different scenarios. |

| **Question** | Participants | Two banks offer savings accounts. Bank A offers 2 percent interest compounded monthly. Bank B offers 4 percent interest compounded monthly. If you deposit $100 in each bank and leave the money untouched, which statement is TRUE after one year? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Bank A will have more money because lower rates are safer", "B. Bank B will have more money because the higher interest rate means more earnings each month", "C. Both accounts will have the same balance because compound interest equalizes over time", "D. Bank A will have more money because 2 percent compounds faster than 4 percent", "E. Neither account will grow because $100 is too small for compound interest to work"] |
