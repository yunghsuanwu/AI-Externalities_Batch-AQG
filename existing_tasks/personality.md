| **Task ID** | personality |
| **Task title** | Studies of personality |
| **Task topic** | Studies of personality |
| **Task description** | Personality psychology examines why people act the way they do and why different people act differently. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about studies of personality, including major theories of personality traits, types, and the factors that shape individual differences. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about studies of personality to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the Big Five personality dimensions, differences between trait and type theories, and how heredity and environment influence personality, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about studies of personality, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying cardinal, central, and secondary traits in real-life examples. 2. Understanding how situational factors versus stable traits predict behavior. 3. Recognizing Type A personality characteristics and their relationship to health outcomes. |
