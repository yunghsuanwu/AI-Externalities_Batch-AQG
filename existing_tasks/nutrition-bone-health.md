| **Task topic** | Nutrition and bone health |
| **Task description** | Good nutrition is fundamental to building and maintaining strong bones throughout life. Calcium and vitamin D are essential nutrients for bone health, with specific intake recommendations varying by age and sex. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about nutrition and bone health, including dietary recommendations, food sources, and how nutrients support bone structure. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about nutrition and bone health to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of calcium and vitamin D intake recommendations by age group, food sources of bone-health nutrients, and how bone remodeling changes with age, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about nutrition and bone health, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining the appropriate calcium intake for individuals of different ages and sexes. 2. Selecting specific foods to meet vitamin D, potassium, or fiber needs for bone health. 3. Applying research findings about foods that preserve bone mineral density. |
