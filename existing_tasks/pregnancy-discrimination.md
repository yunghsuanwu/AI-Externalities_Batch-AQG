| **Task ID** | pregnancy-discrimination |
| **Task title** | Pregnancy discrimination |
| **Task topic** | Pregnancy discrimination laws under Title VII |
| **Task description** | The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) is an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, establishing that discrimination based on pregnancy constitutes unlawful sex discrimination. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about pregnancy discrimination, including protections for hiring and working conditions, leave policies, and health insurance requirements. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about pregnancy discrimination law to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what employers can and cannot require of pregnant employees, how pregnancy leave must be handled compared to other disabilities, and health insurance coverage requirements, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about pregnancy discrimination law, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether an employer's treatment of a pregnant employee violates the PDA by comparing it to treatment of other temporarily disabled employees. 2. When pregnancy-related impairments may qualify for accommodations under the ADA and what employers must provide. 3. How to evaluate whether health insurance policies comply with pregnancy discrimination requirements. |

| **Question** | Participants | Rachel, who is seven months pregnant, works as a warehouse associate.

It does not violate the PDA because pregnancy is different from other medical conditions", "C. It violates the PDA because pregnant employees cannot be singled out for medical clearance procedures not required of employees similar in their ability to work", "D.

| **Question** | Participants | Maria develops gestational diabetes during her pregnancy and her doctor recommends she not lift more than 20 pounds. Her employer offers light duty assignments to employees who are temporarily unable to perform their regular duties due to workplace injuries. Maria requests a similar light duty assignment. Based on pregnancy discrimination law, which of the following is MOST accurate? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. The employer must provide light duty because the PDA requires all pregnant employees receive light duty upon request", "B. The employer is not required to provide light duty because gestational diabetes is not covered by employment discrimination laws", "C. The employer may need to provide light duty under the PDA if similar accommodations are provided to other temporarily disabled employees, and may also need to provide reasonable accommodation under the ADA for the pregnancy-related disability", "D. The employer must provide light duty only if Maria's condition was caused by her work duties", "E. The employer can deny light duty because pregnancy-related conditions are specifically excluded from temporary disability provisions"] |

| **Question** | Participants | An employer's health insurance plan excludes coverage for pre-existing conditions during the first 12 months of employment. Sarah, a new employee, becomes pregnant during her second month of employment after having been pregnant once before. The insurance company denies coverage for her pregnancy-related expenses, claiming her pregnancy is a pre-existing condition. Based on pregnancy discrimination law, which of the following is MOST accurate? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. The denial violates the PDA because pregnancy can never be treated as a pre-existing condition", "B. The denial is permissible under Title VII if the health plan excludes all pre-existing conditions, though other laws may apply to coverage of pre-existing conditions", "C. The denial violates the PDA because health insurance must cover all pregnancy expenses regardless of plan terms", "D. The denial is permissible only if Sarah was pregnant at the time she was hired", "E. The denial violates the PDA because employers must provide full pregnancy coverage to all female employees"] |
