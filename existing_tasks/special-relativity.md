|---|---|
| **Task ID** | special-relativity |
| **Task title** | Special relativity |
| **Task topic** | Two postulates of special relativity |
| **Task description** | In physics, special relativity describes how space, time, and motion behave at speeds approaching the speed of light. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the two postulates of special relativity and their consequences for measurements of length, time, and mass. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the two postulates of special relativity to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how the speed of light behaves for different observers, the effects of high-speed motion on clocks and lengths, and the relationship between energy and mass, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the two postulates of special relativity, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How observers in different reference frames measure the speed of light. 2. Time dilation effects on moving clocks compared to stationary ones. 3. Length contraction and how object dimensions change based on direction of motion. |
