| **Task topic** | Judgment proof status and consumer debt exemptions |
| **Task description** | In South Carolina, certain property is protected from creditors through legal exemptions. If your property falls within these exemptions, you may be "judgment proof," meaning creditors cannot legally collect from you. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about judgment proof status, including exemption thresholds, protected property types, and when this approach may be better than bankruptcy. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about judgment proof status to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of specific exemption dollar amounts, what types of property and income are protected, and how being judgment proof compares to filing bankruptcy, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about judgment proof status, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating whether someone's property equity falls within exemption limits. 2. Determining what happens when a judgment-proof person's circumstances change, such as paying off a car loan or acquiring new property. 3. Evaluating whether joint ownership with a spouse affects exemption amounts. |
