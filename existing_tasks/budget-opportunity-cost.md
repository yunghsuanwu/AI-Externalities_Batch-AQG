| **Task topic** | Budget constraint and opportunity cost |
| **Task description** | In economics, budget constraints and opportunity costs are fundamental concepts that explain how individuals make choices given limited resources. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about budget constraints and opportunity costs and how to apply them to analyze consumer decision-making problems. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about budget constraints and opportunity costs to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how to calculate the slope of a budget constraint, how to determine opportunity costs in terms of forgone goods, and how price or income changes affect the budget constraint, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about budget constraints and opportunity costs, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating opportunity costs when choosing between two goods. 2. Understanding how changes in prices or income shift or rotate the budget constraint. 3. Determining the slope of a budget constraint and interpreting what it represents. |

| **Question** | Participants | Why do rational consumers make choices directly on the budget constraint rather than inside it? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Points inside reflect uncertainty about prices, so consumers avoid them to reduce risk", "B. Points inside require future budget adjustments that rational consumers want to avoid", "C. Points inside represent saving money, but consumers prefer spending to maximize current utility", "D. Points inside mean not fully using resources to maximize potential satisfaction", "E. Points inside the constraint actually cost more than the consumer can afford"] |

| **Question** | Participants | The graph below shows Alphonso's original budget constraint. He originally has $10 per week, with burgers at $2 each and bus tickets at $0.50 each. Now suppose bus tickets increase to $1, burgers increase to $4, and his budget increases to $20.

The budget constraint shifts inward; opportunity cost of bus tickets doubles to $\frac{1}{2}$ burger", "C. The budget constraint rotates, with the burger intercept rising; opportunity cost drops to $\frac{1}{8}$ burger", "D. The budget constraint rotates, with the ticket intercept rising; opportunity cost stays unchanged", "E.
