| **Task ID** | sleep-hygiene |
| **Task title** | Sleep Hygiene |
| **Task topic** | Sleep hygiene practices for better rest |
| **Task description** | Sleep hygiene refers to the habits and behaviors that promote quality sleep, which is essential for physical and mental wellbeing. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about sleep hygiene, including specific timing guidelines, the effects of substances on sleep, and how to manage sleeplessness. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about sleep hygiene to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of caffeine timing restrictions, how alcohol affects sleep quality, and what to do when you cannot fall asleep, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about sleep hygiene, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Evaluating whether specific evening behaviors violate sleep hygiene guidelines. 2. Understanding why certain substances like alcohol and caffeine affect sleep despite common beliefs. 3. Determining the appropriate response when experiencing difficulty falling asleep. |
