| **Task title** | Checking account management |
| **Task topic** | Managing your checking account effectively |
| **Task description** | A checking account is a fundamental financial tool, but poor management can lead to costly fees and even account closure. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about checking account management, including how to avoid overdraft fees, the consequences of account mismanagement, and strategies for tracking your balance. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about checking account management to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of overdraft fees and how to avoid them, consequences of poor account management, and strategies for linking accounts or using ATMs wisely, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about checking account management, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to decide whether to opt-in to debit overdraft coverage based on your spending habits. 2. What steps to take when you need to make a large payment but are unsure about deposit holds. 3. How to minimize fees when you must use an ATM outside your bank's network. |
