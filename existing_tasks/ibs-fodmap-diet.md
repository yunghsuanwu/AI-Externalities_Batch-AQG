| **Task title** | IBS and FODMAP Diet |
| **Task topic** | Managing IBS with the 3-step FODMAP diet |
| **Task description** | The Monash University Low FODMAP Diet is a structured approach to managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms like bloating, gas, and pain by limiting certain sugars that irritate the gut. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the FODMAP diet, including what FODMAPs are, the three steps of the diet, and which foods to swap. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the FODMAP diet for IBS to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what the FODMAP acronym stands for, the purpose and duration of each diet step, and specific high and low FODMAP food swaps, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the FODMAP diet for IBS, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify appropriate low FODMAP substitutes for specific high FODMAP foods across different food categories. 2. How to properly conduct the reintroduction phase, including testing individual FODMAP groups. 3. How to create a personalized long-term diet based on individual FODMAP tolerances. |
