| **Task description** | A certificate of deposit (CD) is a bank product that typically offers higher interest rates than regular savings accounts in exchange for keeping money deposited for a specified term. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about CDs, including FDIC insurance considerations, interest payment structures, and potential risks to avoid. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about certificates of deposit to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of FDIC insurance limits and verification, differences between fixed-rate and market-linked CDs, and warning signs of CD scams, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about certificates of deposit, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to verify whether a CD is actually FDIC-insured and what risks exist when purchasing through third-party brokers. 2. How to evaluate whether your total deposits exceed FDIC coverage limits and what steps to take. 3. How to assess CD terms including automatic renewal policies, early redemption options, and callable features. |

| **Question** | Participants | Marcus purchased a 5-year fixed-rate CD at 4.5% interest two years ago. The CD has an automatic renewal feature and he has not taken any action.

He should check whether the renewal will be at the old rate or the current rate, as renewing at the old rate may not be beneficial", "D. The bank is required by law to renew at the higher of the two rates", "E. Automatic renewal CDs always lock in the original rate for the new term"] |

| **Question** | Participants | Linda is comparing two CD options: a 5-year fixed-rate CD at 4.0% with early redemption allowed (with a penalty), and a 5-year market-linked CD tied to the S&P 500 with potentially higher returns.

Fixed-rate CDs cannot be called by the bank, while market-linked CDs can", "E. Market-linked CDs pay interest monthly, providing more liquidity"] |
