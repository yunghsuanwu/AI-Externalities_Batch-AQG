| **Task ID** | language-development |
| **Task title** | Language development |
| **Task topic** | Language development |
| **Task description** | In psychology, language development examines how humans acquire and master the ability to understand and produce language. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about language development in developmental psychology. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about language development to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the four basic components of language, theories of language acquisition such as Chomsky's nativist approach, and stages of early language development like holophrases and errors of growth, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about language development, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between the basic components of language (phonology, semantics, syntax, pragmatics). 2. Understanding nativist theories including the language acquisition device and critical/sensitive periods. 3. Identifying developmental phenomena like holophrases and errors of growth in child speech examples. |

| **Question** | Participants | Genie suffered from a terrible form of child abuse and was completely isolated from human contact from age 2 to age 13.

| **Question** | Participants | A few years ago, researchers studying communication in a particular species of monkey in Nigeria made the following observation: When an alarm call that normally signaled a leopard was strung together in a sequence with an alarm call that normally signaled an eagle, the resulting sequence elicited group movement (i.e., the sequence meant "let's go!"). If true, this would indicate that these monkeys have a communication system with: |
