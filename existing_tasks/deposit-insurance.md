| **Task title** | FDIC deposit insurance |
| **Task topic** | FDIC deposit insurance coverage and limits |
| **Task description** | The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects depositors' money at insured banks, providing security backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about FDIC deposit insurance, including what types of deposits are insured, coverage limits by account ownership category, and what happens when a bank fails. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about FDIC deposit insurance to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which deposit products are and are not insured, the standard insurance amount and how it applies across different account ownership categories, and how coverage is calculated for joint and trust accounts, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about FDIC deposit insurance, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating total insurance coverage when someone has multiple accounts at the same bank in different ownership categories. 2. Determining whether specific financial products (like CDs, money market accounts, or investments) are covered by FDIC insurance. 3. Understanding how coverage limits apply differently for single, joint, and trust accounts with beneficiaries. |
