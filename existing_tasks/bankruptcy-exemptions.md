| **Task topic** | Washington State Bankruptcy Exemptions |
| **Task description** | Washington bankruptcy exemptions protect certain property when individuals file for bankruptcy, allowing filers to maintain essentials for home and employment while still satisfying creditor claims. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about bankruptcy exemptions, including specific dollar limits, eligibility requirements, and how different bankruptcy chapters treat nonexempt property. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Washington bankruptcy exemptions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of dollar limits for different exemption categories, timing requirements for certain exemptions, and how nonexempt property is handled in Chapters 7 and 13, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Washington bankruptcy exemptions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating whether specific property values fall within exemption limits. 2. Determining how per-item restrictions and timing requirements affect exemption eligibility. 3. Understanding how married couples' exemption amounts differ from individual filers. |
