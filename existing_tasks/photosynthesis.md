| **Task title** | Photosynthesis |
| **Task topic** | Photosynthesis |
| **Task description** | In biology, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to produce glucose and oxygen. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about photosynthesis, including the light-dependent and light-independent reactions and how they work together. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about photosynthesis to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the role of chlorophyll, the differences between light-dependent and light-independent reactions, and the products and byproducts of each stage, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about photosynthesis, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. The energy sources for light-independent reactions (such as ATP and NADPH). 2. The waste products released during light-dependent reactions. 3. Interpreting absorption spectra and understanding why plants appear green. |
