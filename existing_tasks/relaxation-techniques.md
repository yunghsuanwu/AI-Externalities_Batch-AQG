| **Task ID** | relaxation-techniques |
| **Task title** | Relaxation techniques |
| **Task topic** | Relaxation techniques for stress management |
| **Task description** | Relaxation techniques are practices designed to produce the body's relaxation response, which counteracts stress. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about relaxation techniques, including the different types of techniques, what research shows about their effectiveness, and how to apply this knowledge to specific situations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about relaxation techniques to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the physiological effects of relaxation techniques, the differences between various techniques like biofeedback and progressive relaxation, and what research shows about their effectiveness for different conditions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about relaxation techniques, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Which relaxation approaches have the strongest research evidence for specific conditions like pediatric migraines or high blood pressure. 2. Why research findings on relaxation techniques often come with limitations and caveats. 3. How to set realistic expectations about relaxation techniques based on research quality and findings. |
