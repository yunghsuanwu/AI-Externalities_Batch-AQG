| **Task topic** | Solution expressions and dilution |
| **Task description** | In chemistry, solution expressions and dilution concern how to quantify and manipulate the concentration of substances dissolved in solvents. A solution is a homogeneous mixture consisting of a solute (the substance being dissolved, present in lesser amount) and a solvent (the substance doing the dissolving, present in greater amount). A mole (mol) is a unit representing a specific number of particles (6.022 × 10^23), and molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance in grams per mole (g/mol), allowing you to convert from grams to moles by dividing the mass by the molar mass. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about solution expressions and dilution and how to apply them to solve problems involving concentration calculations. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about solution expressions and dilution to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between molarity and molality, the dilution formula and why it works, and the distinction between saturated and unsaturated solutions, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about solution expressions and dilution, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Using the dilution formula to calculate volumes and concentrations. 2. Calculating molality when preparing solutions of a specific concentration. 3. Determining the mass of solute needed to prepare a solution of a given molarity. |
