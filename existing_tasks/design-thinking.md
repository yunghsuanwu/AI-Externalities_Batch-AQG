| **Task title** | Design thinking |
| **Task topic** | Design thinking methodology and human-centered design |
| **Task description** | Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation and problem-solving that has become foundational in business and entrepreneurship. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about design thinking, including its core process spaces, ideation techniques, and the principles of human-centered design. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about design thinking to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the three spaces in design thinking, specific ideation techniques like Top Five and How Might We, and the steps in human-centered design thinking, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about design thinking, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to apply the Five Whys technique to reach the root causes of problems in design contexts. 2. How to select and implement appropriate ideation techniques for different design challenges. 3. How to apply human-centered design principles when developing solutions for specific user groups. |
