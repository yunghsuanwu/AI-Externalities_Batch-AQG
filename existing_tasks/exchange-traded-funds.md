| **Task topic** | Exchange traded funds (ETFs) |
| **Task description** | Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment products that pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about ETFs, including their structure, how investors earn returns, the fees involved, and the different types of ETFs available. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about exchange-traded funds to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how ETFs differ from mutual funds in terms of trading and taxes, the three ways investors earn money from ETFs, and the differences between index funds and actively managed funds, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about exchange-traded funds, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate whether an ETF's fee structure will significantly impact long-term returns. 2. How to determine which type of ETF (stock, bond, target date, money market) is appropriate for a specific investment goal. 3. How to assess the trade-offs between index funds and actively managed funds based on investment objectives. |
