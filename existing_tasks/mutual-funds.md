| **Task description** | Mutual funds are SEC-registered investment companies that pool money from many investors to purchase diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other securities. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about mutual funds, including how investors earn money from them, the different types available, and the costs and risks involved. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about mutual funds to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the three ways investors earn money from mutual funds, the differences between index funds and actively managed funds, and the types of fees that affect investment returns, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about mutual funds, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate and compare different types of mutual funds based on their investment objectives and risk levels. 2. How fees and expenses impact long-term investment returns across different fund types. 3. How to determine which mutual fund category best matches specific investment goals and timelines. |
