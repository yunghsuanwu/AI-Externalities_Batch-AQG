| **Task ID** | peripheral-neuropathy |
| **Task title** | Peripheral neuropathy |
| **Task topic** | Peripheral neuropathy causes, symptoms, and prevention |
| **Task description** | Peripheral neuropathy occurs when nerves outside the brain and spinal cord are damaged, causing symptoms like numbness, pain, and weakness. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about peripheral neuropathy, including the different types of nerves affected, common causes and risk factors, and strategies for prevention and complication management. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about peripheral neuropathy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the differences between nerve types and their symptoms, the relationship between diabetes and neuropathy, and dietary recommendations for preventing vitamin-related neuropathy, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about peripheral neuropathy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying which type of neuropathy a person likely has based on their symptoms and medical history. 2. Recommending appropriate preventive measures for specific populations such as vegetarians or people with diabetes. 3. Determining which nerve types are affected when someone presents with multiple symptoms. |
