| **Task description** | Debt collection is a process that can involve harassment, lawsuits, and court judgments. Understanding your legal rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Texas law can help you respond effectively to collectors and defend yourself in court. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about debt collection rights, including prohibited collector behaviors, lawsuit response procedures, and judgment consequences. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about debt collection rights to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what debt collectors are prohibited from doing, how to respond to lawsuits and discovery requests, and what happens if you ignore a lawsuit, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about debt collection rights, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether a debt collection lawsuit was filed within the legal time limit. 2. What steps to take when served with legal papers and discovery requests. 3. How to evaluate whether you might be judgment proof based on exempt property rules. |
