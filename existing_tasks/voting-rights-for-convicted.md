| **Task title** | Voting rights for the convicted |
| **Task topic** | Voting rights for people with criminal records in Pennsylvania |
| **Task description** | In Pennsylvania, voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions depend on factors such as the type of offense, current confinement status, and timing relative to elections. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Pennsylvania's rules for voting eligibility among people with criminal records, including who can vote, who cannot, and how to register. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Pennsylvania voting rights for people with criminal records to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the difference between felony and misdemeanor confinement, residence requirements for incarcerated voters, and the four-year bar for Election Code violations, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Pennsylvania voting rights for people with criminal records, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether a specific person can vote based on their conviction type and confinement status. 2. Understanding how timing of release relative to an election affects voting eligibility. 3. Applying registration and voting procedures for individuals in different confinement situations. |
