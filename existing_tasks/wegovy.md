| **Task title** | Wegovy |
| **Task topic** | Wegovy injection for weight management |
| **Task description** | Wegovy is an injectable prescription medication used for weight management in adults and children aged 12 and older. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Wegovy, including its dosing schedule, storage requirements, proper use, and potential side effects. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Wegovy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the dose escalation schedule, storage conditions, and how to handle missed doses, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Wegovy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. What to do when a dose is missed depending on timing relative to the next scheduled dose. 2. How to properly store the medication under different circumstances. 3. How to manage common side effects like nausea. |
