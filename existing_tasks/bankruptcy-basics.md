| **Task description** | Bankruptcy is a legal process that allows individuals to eliminate or restructure debts they cannot pay. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about personal bankruptcy, including which debts can and cannot be discharged, the differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and how filing affects property, credit, and family members. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about personal bankruptcy to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of which types of debts survive bankruptcy, the differences between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filings, and how bankruptcy affects spouses and co-signers, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about personal bankruptcy, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which chapter of bankruptcy is appropriate based on income level and debt types. 2. Understanding the consequences of bankruptcy for co-signers, spouses, and family members who received payments. 3. Evaluating whether specific property like homes and cars will be protected or sold during bankruptcy. |
