| **Task title** | High-yield corporate bonds |
| **Task topic** | Understanding high-yield corporate bonds and their risks |
| **Task description** | High-yield corporate bonds, also called "junk bonds," offer higher interest rates but carry greater risk of default. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about high-yield corporate bonds, including the types of companies that issue them, the key risks involved, and the important terms investors should understand before investing. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about high-yield corporate bonds to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, how covenant protections work, and what happens when bonds are called, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about high-yield corporate bonds, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to evaluate call provisions and their impact on reinvestment when interest rates change. 2. How to compare bonds with different levels of covenant protections and assess which offers better bondholder protection. 3. How to analyze payment terms like PIK provisions to determine if a bond matches your income needs. |

| **Question** | Participants | Elena is comparing two high-yield bonds from companies in the same industry. Bond X has extensive covenant protections including restrictions on shareholder dividends and additional debt, while Bond Y is described as "covenant-lite." Both offer the same interest rate. Which assessment is MOST accurate? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Bond Y is safer because fewer restrictions indicate financial strength", "B. Bond X offers better protection for bondholders because covenants restrict actions that could harm repayment ability", "C. Both bonds carry identical risk since they have the same interest rate", "D. Bond Y will have a higher market price due to the company's greater operational flexibility", "E. Covenant protections are irrelevant for high-yield bonds because default risk is already high"] |

| **Question** | Participants | Robert is reviewing a high-yield bond prospectus and sees that the payment terms allow the issuer to "skip an interest payment under certain conditions" and also offer payment-in-kind options. If Robert prioritizes receiving regular cash income from his investment, what is the MOST appropriate action? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Invest in this bond because PIK payments compound returns over time", "B. Assume the skip provisions will never be used because they would damage the company's reputation", "C. Request that the broker modify the bond terms to guarantee cash payments", "D. Avoid this bond or ensure he understands when cash payments might be replaced or skipped", "E. Invest because SEC regulations prevent companies from actually using skip provisions"] |
