| **Task topic** | Public policy, interest, and power |
| **Task description** | In political science, public policy refers to all the decisions governments make to influence behavior, while power and interest shape how these policies are created and contested. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about public policy, public interest, and power, including concepts like sovereignty, political conflict, and bargaining outcomes. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about public policy, interest, and power to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the definitions of key terms like sovereignty and status quo, the distinctions between nation and state, and how political bargaining leads to different outcomes, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about public policy, interest, and power, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between related concepts such as nation, state, country, and nation-state. 2. Understanding the difference between de jure and de facto rules. 3. Applying bargaining frameworks to predict outcomes in political negotiations. |
