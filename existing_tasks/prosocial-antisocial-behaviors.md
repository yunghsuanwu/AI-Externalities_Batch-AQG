| **Task title** | Prosocial and antisocial behaviors |
| **Task topic** | Prosocial and antisocial behaviors |
| **Task description** | In psychology, prosocial and antisocial behaviors examine why people help others or act aggressively in social situations. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about prosocial and antisocial behaviors, including the key theories and research findings that explain when and why people help or harm others. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about prosocial and antisocial behaviors to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility, the empathy-altruism hypothesis, and social learning theory of aggression, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about prosocial and antisocial behaviors, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Predicting helping behavior based on the number of bystanders present. 2. Applying the empathy-altruism model to real-world scenarios. 3. Understanding how children learn aggressive behavior through observation and modeling. |

Four passive confederates, two passive confederates, two naive subjects, alone", "C. Two naive subjects, two passive confederates, alone, four passive confederates", "D.
