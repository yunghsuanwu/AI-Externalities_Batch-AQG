| **Task topic** | Characteristics of monopoly |
| **Task description** | In economics, a monopoly is a market structure where a single firm dominates an industry due to various barriers that prevent competitors from entering. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the characteristics of monopoly, including the different types of barriers to entry and how they affect market competition. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the characteristics of monopoly to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the different types of barriers to entry, the distinction between natural monopolies and legal monopolies, and the role of intellectual property protections like patents in creating monopoly power, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the characteristics of monopoly, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between government-enforced and non-government-enforced barriers to entry. 2. Understanding how economies of scale lead to natural monopolies. 3. Analyzing the effects of changes to intellectual property protections on market competition and innovation. |
