| **Task title** | Voter protection |
| **Task topic** | Voter intimidation laws and protections |
| **Task description** | Voter intimidation is prohibited under multiple federal laws, and every state has additional protections for voters. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about voter protection, including what constitutes illegal voter intimidation, the specific federal statutes that prohibit it, and the rights voters have when their qualifications are challenged. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about voter protection laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of specific federal statutes prohibiting voter intimidation, examples of conduct that constitutes illegal intimidation, and voter rights when facing challenges at polling places, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about voter protection laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining whether specific conduct near polling places constitutes illegal voter intimidation under federal law. 2. Understanding when speech is protected by the First Amendment versus when it crosses into unprotected intimidation. 3. Knowing what actions to take and what rights you retain if you witness or experience voter intimidation. |
