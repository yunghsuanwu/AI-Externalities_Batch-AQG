| **Task ID** | congruences |
| **Task title** | Congruences |
| **Task topic** | Congruences in number theory |
| **Task description** | In number theory, congruences describe a relationship between integers based on their remainders when divided by a given number. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about congruences and how to apply the rules of modular arithmetic to solve problems. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about congruences in number theory to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the definition of congruences, properties and rules for manipulating congruences, and Fermat's Little Theorem, so pay attention to these details. Note: You will be given the triple bar symbol ($\equiv$) when explaining congruences. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about congruences in number theory, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining when expressions are divisible by a given modulus. 2. Checking whether two numbers are congruent modulo n. 3. Finding remainders of large powers using Fermat's Little Theorem and modular reduction. |
