| **Task title** | International transfers with IBAN and SWIFT |
| **Task topic** | IBAN and SWIFT codes for international money transfers |
| **Task description** | International money transfers require specific banking codes to ensure funds reach the correct destination. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about IBAN and SWIFT codes, including their structure, purposes, and when to use each for transfers to different regions of the world. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about IBAN and SWIFT codes to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the structure and components of each code type, which regions require which codes, and how to determine the correct codes for specific transfer scenarios, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about IBAN and SWIFT codes, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining which code(s) are needed when sending money to specific countries or regions. 2. Interpreting the components of IBAN and SWIFT codes to identify country, bank, and account information. 3. Avoiding common transfer errors by understanding the distinct functions of each code type. |
