| **Task title** | Deposit Accounts |
| **Task topic** | Deposit Accounts at FDIC-Insured Banks |
| **Task description** | Deposit accounts at FDIC-insured banks provide secure ways to manage money while earning interest. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about deposit accounts, including the different types of accounts available, FDIC insurance protection, and various payment services banks offer. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about deposit accounts to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of FDIC insurance coverage limits, differences between CDs and savings accounts, and when to use money orders versus personal checks, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about deposit accounts, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Choosing between a CD and other savings options based on time horizon and liquidity needs. 2. Selecting the appropriate payment method when a recipient requires guaranteed funds. 3. Identifying which banking services to use for specific needs like international transfers or automatic bill payments. |
