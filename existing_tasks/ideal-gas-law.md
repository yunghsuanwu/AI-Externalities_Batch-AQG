| **Task ID** | ideal-gas-law |
| **Task title** | Ideal gas law |
| **Task topic** | Ideal gas law |
| **Task description** | In physics, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the ideal gas law and how to apply it to solve problems involving gases under varying conditions. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the ideal gas law to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the properties of ideal gases, the relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature, and special cases like isothermal, isobaric, and isochoric processes, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the ideal gas law, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating final pressure or volume when temperature and other variables change. 2. Determining what combinations of pressure and volume changes produce a specific temperature change. 3. Describing the graphical relationships (linear, positively related, etc.) between variables in isothermal and isobaric processes. |
