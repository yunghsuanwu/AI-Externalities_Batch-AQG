| **Task title** | Intestacy |
| **Task topic** | New York intestacy laws and estate administration |
| **Task description** | When a person dies without a Last Will and Testament, their property is distributed according to state law. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about New York intestacy laws, including how property is divided among surviving relatives, which children qualify to inherit, and how to file for estate administration. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about New York intestacy laws to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how property is divided between spouses and children, which types of children can legally inherit, and who has priority to file for estate administration, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about New York intestacy laws, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Determining how an estate would be divided among different combinations of surviving family members. 2. Evaluating whether specific children (adopted, stepchildren, children born outside marriage) qualify to inherit. 3. Identifying who has the right to file for administration when multiple family members survive the decedent. |
