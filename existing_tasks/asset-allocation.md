| **Task topic** | Asset allocation, diversification, and rebalancing |
| **Task description** | Asset allocation is a foundational investment strategy that involves dividing investments among different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about asset allocation, including how time horizon and risk tolerance affect allocation decisions, the principles of diversification, and methods for rebalancing a portfolio. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about asset allocation to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how time horizon affects investment decisions, the purpose and methods of diversification, and when and how to rebalance a portfolio, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about asset allocation, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine appropriate asset allocation based on an investor's time horizon and risk tolerance. 2. How to evaluate whether a portfolio is properly diversified across asset classes and sectors. 3. How to decide when and how to rebalance a portfolio that has drifted from its target allocation. |
