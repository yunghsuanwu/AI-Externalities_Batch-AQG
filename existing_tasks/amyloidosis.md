| **Task ID** | amyloidosis |
| **Task title** | Amyloidosis |
| **Task topic** | Amyloidosis types, symptoms, and risk factors |
| **Task description** | Amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by abnormal protein buildup in organs, potentially affecting the heart, kidneys, liver, and nervous system. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about amyloidosis, including its different types, associated risk factors, characteristic symptoms, and how it damages various organs. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about amyloidosis to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the different types of amyloidosis and their triggers, which populations are at higher risk, and how the disease affects specific organs, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about amyloidosis, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to identify which type of amyloidosis is most likely based on a patient's medical history and risk factors. 2. Which organ systems are being affected based on specific symptoms a patient experiences. 3. Why certain populations face higher risks for specific types of amyloidosis. |
