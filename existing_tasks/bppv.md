| **Task title** | Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |
| **Task topic** | Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) |
| **Task description** | Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo, characterized by brief episodes of dizziness triggered by changes in head position. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about BPPV, including its symptoms, causes, risk factors, and warning signs that require medical attention. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of what triggers BPPV symptoms, how the inner ear structures contribute to the condition, and when someone should seek emergency care, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to distinguish BPPV symptoms from symptoms that indicate a more serious condition requiring emergency care. 2. How specific inner ear structures malfunction to cause BPPV episodes. 3. How to identify which individuals are at higher risk for developing BPPV. |

| **Question** | Participants | Maria, age 68, has been diagnosed with osteoporosis and recently recovered from a fall that caused a minor head injury. She now notices brief dizziness when she lies down at night. Her daughter, age 35, also reports similar brief dizzy spells when looking up. Based on BPPV risk factors, which statement BEST describes their situations? |
| **Options** | Participants | ["A. Maria has multiple risk factors for BPPV, while her daughter has none of the identified risk factors", "B. Both women have equal risk since BPPV affects all ages and backgrounds equally", "C. The daughter is at higher risk because BPPV is more common in younger women", "D. Neither woman is at significant risk because BPPV only affects males", "E. Maria's osteoporosis is protective against BPPV because it strengthens the inner ear"] |
