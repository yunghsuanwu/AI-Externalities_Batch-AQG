| **Task topic** | Federal voting rights and registration rules |
| **Task description** | Federal and state laws work together to protect citizens' right to vote while establishing rules for voter registration and election administration. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about voting rights, including which federal laws protect voters, how voter registration works, and what to do when problems arise at the polls. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about voting rights and registration to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of federal voting protection laws, voter registration deadlines and removal rules, and provisional ballot procedures, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about voting rights, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. What happens to a voter's registration if they do not respond to address confirmation notices. 2. What rights voters have when they move or when their name is missing from poll books. 3. How to determine whether an election practice violates federal anti-discrimination laws. |
