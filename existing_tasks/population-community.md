| **Task title** | Population and community |
| **Task topic** | Population and community |
| **Task description** | In biology, ecology studies how organisms interact with each other and their environment at various levels of organization. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about population and community concepts, including ecological hierarchies, population growth, and species interactions. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about population and community ecology to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the ecological hierarchy, population growth patterns and carrying capacity, and types of species interactions like competition and predation, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about population and community ecology, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How gene flow between populations affects evolution. 2. Calculating population growth under exponential conditions. 3. Identifying factors that affect carrying capacity and population dynamics after environmental changes. |
