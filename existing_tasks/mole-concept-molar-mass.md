| **Task topic** | The mole concept and molar mass |
| **Task description** | In chemistry, the mole concept provides a way to count and measure enormous quantities of atoms, molecules, and other particles using Avogadro's number. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about the mole concept and molar mass and how to apply them to solve quantitative chemistry problems. You do not need to memorize particular molar mass or atomic mass units values; all values will be given when needed. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about the mole concept and molar mass to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of Avogadro's number and its applications, calculating molar masses of compounds, and the relationship between moles, mass, and gas volumes at standard temperature and pressure (STP), so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about the mole concept and molar mass, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Calculating molar mass from chemical formulas. 2. Converting between grams, moles, and number of particles. 3. Using molar volume of gases at standard temperature and pressure (STP) to determine moles or identify substances. |
