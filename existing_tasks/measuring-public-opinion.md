| **Task title** | Measuring public opinion |
| **Task topic** | Measuring public opinion |
| **Task description** | Public opinion polls provide a scientific way of measuring what citizens think about political and social issues. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about how public opinion is measured, including different sampling methods and sources of error that can affect poll accuracy. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about measuring public opinion to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of different sampling methods used in polling, types of bias and error that affect poll accuracy, and when different sampling approaches should be used, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about measuring public opinion, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Identifying types of bias in polling scenarios (such as interviewer bias, social desirability bias, and selection bias). 2. Distinguishing between different sampling methods (probability sampling, convenience sampling, cluster sampling). 3. Selecting appropriate sampling methods for specific research goals. |
