| **Task description** | In sociology, formal organizations are large secondary organizations that are highly bureaucratized, including schools, businesses, healthcare systems, and government institutions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about formal organizations, their types, the structure of bureaucracies, and the concept of McDonaldization in society. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about formal organizations to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the three types of formal organizations (normative, coercive, and utilitarian), the key characteristics of bureaucracies, and the advantages and disadvantages of McDonaldization, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about formal organizations, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Distinguishing between normative, coercive, and utilitarian organizations and identifying real-world examples of each. 2. Recognizing the characteristics of bureaucracies and their intended positive aspects. 3. Understanding the principles of McDonaldization and evaluating its effects on society. |
