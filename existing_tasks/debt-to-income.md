| **Task title** | Debt to income ratio |
| **Task topic** | Calculating and interpreting debt-to-income ratios |
| **Task description** | The debt-to-income ratio is a key financial metric that measures how much of your monthly income goes toward paying debts. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about debt-to-income ratios, including how to calculate them, what the recommended guidelines are for homeowners and renters, and how this ratio affects your financial health. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about debt-to-income ratios to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of how to calculate debt-to-income ratios, the recommended ratio guidelines for homeowners versus renters, and what counts as debt in these calculations, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about debt-to-income ratios, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to calculate debt-to-income ratios when income varies month to month. 2. Whether specific payments (like child support or rent) should be included in debt calculations. 3. What steps to take when your debt-to-income ratio exceeds recommended guidelines. |
