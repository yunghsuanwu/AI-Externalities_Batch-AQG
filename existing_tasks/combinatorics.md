|---|---|
| **Task ID** | combinatorics |
| **Task title** | Combinatorics |
| **Task topic** | Combinatorics: permutations and combinations |
| **Task description** | Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics concerned with counting arrangements and selections of objects. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about combinatorics, including permutations and combinations, and how to apply them to solve counting problems. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about combinatorics to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the difference between permutations and combinations, calculating factorials, and when order matters in counting problems, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about combinatorics, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Arranging objects in order (permutations), such as books on a shelf. 2. Selecting groups where order doesn't matter (combinations), such as forming committees. 3. Counting with constraints, such as forming numbers without repeating digits. |
| **Formulas** | {"permutation": "P(n,k) = $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\cdots[n - (k - 1)]$", "combination": "C(n,k) = $\frac{P(n,k)}{k!}$"} |
