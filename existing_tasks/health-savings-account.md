| **Task topic** | Health savings accounts and their tax benefits |
| **Task description** | Health savings accounts (HSAs) are tax-advantaged accounts that can be used for medical expenses, savings, and investing. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about HSAs, including eligibility requirements, contribution rules, tax benefits, investment options, and what happens when HSA funds are used for non-medical expenses. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about health savings accounts to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of HSA eligibility requirements and contribution rules, the triple tax advantage of HSAs, and rules for using HSA funds before and after age 65, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about health savings accounts, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Whether someone qualifies to open and contribute to an HSA based on their health insurance situation. 2. How to evaluate HSA investment options while considering fees and potential growth. 3. The tax consequences of using HSA funds for different purposes at different ages. |
