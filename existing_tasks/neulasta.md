|---|---|
| **Task ID** | neulasta |
| **Task title** | Neulasta |
| **Task topic** | Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) medication for chemotherapy patients |
| **Task description** | Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) is a prescription medication used to reduce the risk of infection in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy by boosting white blood cell production. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about Neulasta, including who should use it, how to store and administer it properly, and how to recognize serious side effects. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about Neulasta to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of storage temperature requirements and timing, serious side effects and their warning signs, and special precautions for patients with conditions like latex allergies or sickle cell disorder, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about Neulasta, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to recognize warning signs of serious complications like spleen rupture, MDS/AML, or Capillary Leak Syndrome and respond appropriately. 2. How to handle storage and administration timing errors, such as medication left at room temperature. 3. How to navigate special circumstances like latex allergies when using Neulasta prefilled syringes. |
