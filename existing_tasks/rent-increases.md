| **Task title** | Rent Increases |
| **Task topic** | California tenant rights and rent increase protections |
| **Task description** | California's Tenant Protection Act limits how much landlords can raise rent and provides important protections against unlawful evictions. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about rent increase caps, notice requirements, just cause eviction protections, and other key tenant rights under California law. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about California tenant rights and rent increases to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of rent increase caps and notice requirements, just cause eviction protections, and security deposit rules, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about California tenant rights and rent increases, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to determine whether a specific rent increase is lawful based on location, timing, and percentage. 2. Whether a tenant qualifies for just cause eviction protections based on their housing situation. 3. What actions a tenant should take when facing potential violations of their rights. |

| **Question** | Participants | Priya has lived in her Los Angeles County apartment for eight months. Her landlord has issued her a 30-day notice to vacate because the landlord's adult daughter wants to move into the unit. The apartment building was constructed in 1995.

Yes, because the building is more than 15 years old and therefore covered by the Tenant Protection Act", "C. No, because just cause protections do not apply to tenants who have lived in a unit for less than one year", "D. No, because owner move-in for a family member is always permitted regardless of tenant protections", "E. Yes, because 30 days' notice is insufficient for any eviction in Los Angeles County"] |
