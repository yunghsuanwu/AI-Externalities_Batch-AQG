| **Task title** | Diabetes Meal Planning |
| **Task topic** | Diabetes meal planning basics |
| **Task description** | Diabetes meal planning involves making food choices that help manage blood glucose levels while maintaining a healthy diet. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about diabetes meal planning, including carbohydrate counting, using the My Plate Planner method, and identifying foods to limit or include. |
| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about diabetes meal planning to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of carbohydrate serving sizes and counting, the My Plate Planner portion method, and which foods to limit or include, so pay attention to these details. |
| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about diabetes meal planning, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. How to properly arrange different food types on a plate using the My Plate Planner method. 2. How to calculate the number of carbohydrate servings from food label information. 3. How to select appropriate foods and beverages based on diabetes meal planning guidelines. |
