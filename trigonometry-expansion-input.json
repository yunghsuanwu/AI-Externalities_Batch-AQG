One of the topic is trigonometric functions. |\n| **Task description** | In math, trigonometry concerns the relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles. In this task, you will need to learn as much as you can about fundamental trigonometric functions and how to apply them to triangles to solve problems. |\n| **Task instruction for Explainer** | You will need to provide clear and accurate information about fundamental trigonometric functions to your partner later. Your partner may come with specific questions with details, including but not exhaustive of the relationships between different functions and some special triangles, so pay attention to these details. |\n| **Task instruction for Learner** | Your partner will have gained knowledge about fundamental trigonometric functions, and you will have to learn from them by asking them to explain. Beyond general information, you should learn about how to solve problems that concern the following: 1. Special right triangle with angles like 30-60-90. 2. Isosceles right triangles (right triangles with two equal sides). 3.

We'll begin our study by reviewing the definitions of the\ntrig functions, first with acute angles in right triangles and then with arbitrary angles and real numbers.\nTRIG fuNCTIONS OF AcuTE ANGLES\nThe classical definitions of the six trig functions-sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent­\nuse the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.

That is, the sine of B's complement (namely, A) is cos B, which is where the name \"cosine\" comes\nfrom (complement's sine). The same is true for the other pairs of cofunctions-tangent and cotangent,\nsecant and cosecant. You'll also notice certain reciprocal relationships among the functions. Cosecant is\nthe reciprocal of sine, secant is the reciprocal of cosine, and cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent. Finally,\nall of the trig functions can be written in terms of sine and cosine: The reciprocal relationships take care\nof secant and cosecant, and it's easy to see that tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine, and cotangent is the\nratio of cosine to sine.\nTwo special right triangles allow us to determine the numerical values of the trig functions of the\nangles 30°, 45°, and 60°.\n22 + CRACKING THE GRE MATHEMATICS SUBJECT TEST\n\n30\n2\n1\n1 1\n30° 60° 60° 30° J3\nsin = cos sin = cos =\n= _!2 2\n2\ncsc45° = sec45° = J2 esc 30° = sec 60° = 2 esc 60° = sec 30°\n= -\nJ3\n1\n30° c 60° 60° 30°\ntan = ot = tan = cot =\nJ3\nJ3\ny\nX"
